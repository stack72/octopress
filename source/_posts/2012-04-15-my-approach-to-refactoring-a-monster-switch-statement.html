title: "My approach to refactoring a monster switch statement"

<p>I had to refactor some very old code a while back. The code looked similar to this:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/02f6a05870b5b2dd277f.js"></script>
<p>I had to refactor it so that I could add more parts to it. There was no way I could add in more case statements so it all had to go. I took a cautious approach to the refactoring as it was pretty brittle and quite important code. The first step in refactoring made the code look as follows:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/e263574855d5dc9b19fd.js"></script>
<p>This mean that I could make sure that the function of the code didn&rsquo;t change but that it was easier to read. This still couldn&rsquo;t be unit tested though as there was no way to mock the behaviour of the case statements &ndash; it was all still in the same class. The next refactoring step was to allow some unit tests to be written. I was able to separate the behaviours into their own class and made the code look as follows:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/ce53ce246dcf5f9bcaaa.js"></script>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t enough for me. I still had this huge switch statement that was breaking the <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/ocp.pdf" target="_blank">Open / Closed principle</a>. This meant that in order to add more functionality to the switch, I had to change the switch and risk breaking it. This couldn&rsquo;t happen. This made my final part of the code look as similar:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/843ed2eeaf5fab2e3c7f.js"></script>
<p>With this code I could make sure that I could write some unit tests around the behaviour of the class. This post only talks about going this far. I have since refactored the TaskRunner class much more as it was doing a lot more than 1 thing and thus breaking <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/srp.pdf" target="_blank">SRP</a>. How would you have handled the same refactoring?</p>
