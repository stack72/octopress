<p>During a work trip, I was prompted to get back into recalling how memory management in .net works as my company found a bit of an issue when they migrated their codebase from .net 3.5 to .net 4.</p>
<p>Lots of searching on Google and reading of MSDN documentation helped me get back to speed on what I knew before and then I found an email from <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/">Redgate</a> in my inbox. Those awesome folk have created a simple storyboard of how it works to make it easy to understand. This has been sent to all the developers on my team as this is a great resource.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest checking this resource out: <a title="http://stack72.me/uT8A1z" href="http://stack72.me/uT8A1z">Memory Management in .Net</a></p>
