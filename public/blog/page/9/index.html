  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while back I wrote a post on what passion means to me. Someone asked me to discuss how I achieved a work / life balance so I thought I&rsquo;d write this post while on holiday (ironic eh!)</p>
<p>So, as someone who believes they have passion, I guess i can be described as working a lot. This doesn&rsquo;t just mean my day job but it means studying/reading new things, writing code of my own for research applications or helping others with development related tasks. I read a lot of development books as well so I&rsquo;m sure this can really eat into my time.</p>
<p>I personally think that definitions of disconnecting and developer burnout&nbsp; are subjective. But even more, each developer has their own way or preventing burnout and from disconnecting from their life as a developer. I am absolutely addicted to twitter and I am on there an awful lot. I don&rsquo;t feel that when I&rsquo;m on twitter that I&rsquo;m working or engaging in work. Certainly it can make me talk about work but I don&rsquo;t generally have Visual Studio open while I&rsquo;m on there. This, to me, means that twitter isn&rsquo;t really stopping me from disconnecting. I use it more as a social networking tool &ndash; to talk to other developers who can help me, to bookmark articles for use later when I am on my laptop.</p>
<p>So what is disconnecting to me? I feel that it&rsquo;s when I don&rsquo;t writing code, don&rsquo;t do overtime at work, don&rsquo;t look at emails and generally don&rsquo;t do any development related tasks. I can still tweet &ndash; twitter is facebook for geeks so tweeting is just being social! Disconnecting goes hand in hand with trying to prevent myself burning out. Burning out is doing far too much &ndash; this can stem from working too many hours or working strange or anti-social hours. This can cause slight depression in some cases or problems at home. First stage of burnout to me is when I cannot sleep because all I can think about is my work or my projects.</p>
<p>Burnout I&rsquo;m told can be a bit of a killer to a developer. Burnout can occur when a developer works too much. This can be overtime for day job or can be working late hours on a personal project. I don&rsquo;t feel I have been &ldquo;burnt out&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m honestly not in a position to say this. I&rsquo;m sure my girlfriend would be a better judge of this. In order to try and stay away from burnout I tend to try and have 3 nights a week away from work related activities. During this time I still tweet (but hey its on my phone so its ok ;)) but I don&rsquo;t actively do any development related activities unless they are classed as incredibly urgent. My girlfriend and my dog are the things that keep me focused way from work when I&rsquo;m on a &ldquo;night off&rdquo;. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll continue to not be 100% workaholic but as my job changes or new things happen or are released in the development work things may change. Lets just hope that I can be strong and not give up all my free time!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past month I have volunteered to help out in the creation of some <a href="http://nuget.org" target="_blank">nuget</a> packages. The packages I said I&rsquo;d help with are NUnit and Simple.Data. I volunteered as I have a dedi box and wanted to try and script it from my TeamCity installation.</p>
<p>In order to get the projects working I have created a custom MSBuild script that does things in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build </li>
<li>Zip </li>
<li>Package </li>
<li>Nuget Creation </li>
</ul>
<ul>
This was all thanks to help from <a href="http://www.jeremyskinner.co.uk" target="_blank">Jeremy Skinner</a>. Jeremy has managed to do all the steps above&nbsp; as part of his build but chooses to run the push to nuget.org from a powershell script. manually so he can make sure it never happens unexpectedly. I am very much a fan of automation. Therefore I wanted to find a way to automate this push to nuget as part of a specific build configuration. Out of the box, TeamCity has no powershell build runner. In order to try to execute the powershell script, I was wrapping the call in a .cmd file. But this was not working fantastically and was hanging and throwing errors for me. 
</ul>
<ul>
I managed to find a <a href="http://teamcity.jetbrains.net/viewType.html?buildTypeId=bt268&amp;tab=buildTypeStatusDiv" target="_blank">Powershell TeamCity plugin</a> (login as a guest to see it). This allowed a build step to be added to TeamCity config that execute Powershell scripts directly and therefore helps to automate the process. 
</ul>
<p>When this script is installed I see the following in my TeamCity build runner menu</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_10.png"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_10.png" border="0" alt="image" width="330" height="198" /></a></p>
<p>A simple call to the correct .ps1 file means the publish to nuget! Hope this helps</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the xmas period I read a book I have wanted to for a while now, <a href="http://www.manning.com/hay/" target="_blank">Azure in Action</a>. I didn&rsquo;t know anything at all about the cloud. In fact, my thoughts were that you could take an existing application and host it in &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; without any real thought process. This turned out to be incorrect.</p>
<p>The authors help the reader to see the power of Azure. They also help to describe what Azure actually is and it&rsquo;s structure. The book also describes how items are stored (using BLOBs) and how this compares to the normal means of storage (SAN, DFS etc.)</p>
<p>The most impressive thin I learned from reading this book, was how the different roles on Azure work. The decisions required for scalability of our application help to drive decisions based on the amount of roles required and the ability to scale out or scale up.</p>
<p>The book also talks about the API&rsquo;s required for dealing with the storage mechanisms and how you can interact with these APIs both inside and outside of the Azure platform.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So what do I learn from this book?</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, simple, a lot. I learned that I cannot just host my existing service in the cloud &ndash; I need to think more about my application, e.g. trust levels, its state, storage etc. I also need to think about configuration as a web.config cannot be changed on the fly like a normal web application. The use of the service definition files mean the application can potentially become more flexible as configuration can be shared between azure and non-azure environments.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Would I recommend this book to a friend?</span></strong></p>
<p>Without a doubt! I&rsquo;d thoroughly recommend this book. This book is suitable for those that know very little about Azure but really want to learn about it but want to see what Azure actually is and how to start using it. I enjoyed this book so much I&rsquo;m hoping that a new version will be created to show the changes in Azure that were announced at PDC2010.</p>
<p>Thanks to the authors, Chris Hay and Brian Prince for a well written book, also thanks to Manning books for publishing it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks back, <a href="http://twitter.com/craigber" target="_blank">Craig Bernston</a> posted a link about how MSBuild files can be debugged! I wasn&#8217;t sure if this was possible so I followed the guide to get it going. I hit a few snags with trying to get msbuild working (or so I thought) but it was down to x86 and x64 versions. </p>  <p>It has taken me a while to post this so that I can actually try this out and make sure that it works – i can’t be responsible for passing around a link that causes harm ;) The guide is here - <a title="http://stack72.me/gfGTse" href="http://stack72.me/gfGTse">http://stack72.me/gfGTse</a></p>  <p>The start of the guide talks about how to add the registry information to allow this to happen. Please note the following caveat to that information:</p>  <p>If you are on a x64 system – then you will usually start the cmd.exe in x64 version. Therefore when you are actually starting the msbuild version you have just edited it will usually be on the following path</p>  <p>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319</p>  <p>so when you are trying to debug a msbuild file open a command prompt and run a command similar to as follows:</p>  <p>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\msbuild.exe /t:rebuild /debug &lt;project or solution path here&gt;</p>  <p>This will then allow you to proceed and debug the file as necessary. This has brought me a lot of happiness as it has helped me create killer build scripts.</p>  <p>Happy building!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post is not in any way going to tell you what PostSharp is &ndash; you will need to check their <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/" target="_blank">website</a> for a full explanation of what it is and what it can do. In a nutshell, I am using PostSharp for Attribute Based Caching in ASP.NET. In order to get this working there was 2 ways to deal with PostSharp.</p>
<p>PostSharp have a section about using the product on a build server as it needs a licence. This requires an install so that it can extend MSbuild to create the appropriate output. But I didn&rsquo;t like this approach as I like to keep my build server as clean as possible from installs.</p>
<p>1. I could install PostSharp on the development machine <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> any other machine that will require to build the application (i.e build server).</p>
<p>2. I could try and use the PostSharp download in my solution tools folder and customise my .csproj file to hook into the MSbuild event. This is of course the path I took.</p>
<p>So I started by signing up to PostSharp and getting a licence key and downloading the source. I took the entire source and unzipped it to my lib folder inside my solution as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_7.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_7.png" border="0" alt="image" width="244" height="192" /></a></p>
<p>This now means I have the source that is required. In order to &lsquo;tap&rsquo; into this source I next need to change the .csproj file of the project that requires PostSharp use.&nbsp; I have changed my .csproj to include the lines as follows below the Microsoft.CSharp.targets import:</p>
<p>&lt;Import Project=&#8221;..&#46;.\lib\PostSharp\PostSharp.targets&#8221; /&gt;</p>
<p>This imports a .targets file that is referenced in my lib in the PostSharp folder. This .targets file actually needs to have your licence key inside it if you don&rsquo;t have an install of PostSharp locally. This means opening the .targets file in programmers notepad (or your favourite editor) and adding the following line just before the closing PropertyGroup tag:</p>
<p>(your licence key will be emailed to you when you join PostSharp)</p>
<p>&lt;PostSharpLicenseKey&gt;license key here&lt;/PostSharpLicenseKey&gt;</p>
<p>When I checked my solution into source control and ran the build then my TeamCity build log showed the following information:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_8.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_8.png" border="0" alt="image" width="614" height="220" /></a></p>
<p>This basically means that PostSharp hooked into my build event to make the following code snippet actually work.</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_9.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_9.png" border="0" alt="image" width="584" height="130" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any developer who works with this code will not require PostSharp installed on their machine and can work freely <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/wlEmoticon-smile_5.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have just installed a new extension to Visual Studio 2010 using the Extension manager and then realised I&rsquo;d have to do the same at home. Seems very laborious doesn&rsquo;t it!! Why isn&rsquo;t there a way to be able to get an output of the installations you have installed and their download links (maybe in an xml type format) that I could then export and store in dropbox.</p>
<p>Format could have the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extension Name</li>
<li>Version</li>
<li>Download location/ online gallery location</li>
<li>Publisher</li>
</ul>
<ul>
I&rsquo;d then like to be able to take this xml file and import it to a new extension manager of my choice and then tell visual studio to go off and download the required extensions. In the era of cloud computing I really thought this would be possible I think its even more important when developers are switching between machines. 
</ul>
<p>Do we ever think something like this will be developed? Is anyone interested in a product like this &ndash; lets try and get it implemented! Its only the same functionality they have when you can export bookmarks and ftp locations from other tools.&nbsp;<img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/wlEmoticon-smile_4.png" alt="Smile" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: There is currently the ability to have a personal Nuget repository so this &#8216;extension repository&#8217; would be great for sharing in a team as well!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So Saturday past, 29th January 2011, was DDD9, Organised by Craig Murphy, Phil Winstanley and Dave Sussman et all. All I can say is what a thoroughly enjoyable day. As I was speaking in the last session of the day, I was a bit too nervous to go to every session. But I dipped in and out of a few. Here&rsquo;s my highlights:</p>
<h4>.Net Collections Deep Dive &ndash; Gary Short</h4>
<p>Well I have seen Gary present before and I think he&#8217;s an awesome presenter but I hadn&rsquo;t seen this session. So I thought I could learn a lot. I wasn&rsquo;t wrong &ndash; I learned a lot of new data structures that I didn&rsquo;t know existed as I don&rsquo;t use them for anything.</p>
<p>This session has prompted me to really think about what I use and for what scenarios. Shame there wasn&rsquo;t time for more of this talk &ndash; but the questions kept on coming for Gary and people made him run out of time I think.</p>
<h4>Functional Alchemy: Tricks to keep your C# DRY &ndash; Mark Rendle</h4>
<p>What can we say about Mark &ndash; his sessions are fun. This is like the 4th time I have seen this session and I keep picking up new parts to it. What made it even better was the interaction between Jon Skeet and Mark on ways which things could be done differently to Marks way</p>
<h4>Is your code S.O.L.I.D ? &ndash; Nathan Gloyn</h4>
<p>I has seen a lot of talks on SOLID and have been inspired by quite a few but this one was completely different. Nathan related the SOLID principles to real world code and that made such a huge difference. Well delivered and with good explanations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real shame that I wasn&rsquo;t able to watch the end of the session since my laptop started to not work well when I was messing with some demos before my own session</p>
<h4>Enforcing Code &lsquo;Beauty&rsquo; With StyleCop &ndash; Guy Smith-Ferrier</h4>
<p>I have to admit I was a bit interested in this session as I have had some interesting times with StyleCop before so i thought I&rsquo;d go along. I was actually going to go to Colin Gemmell&rsquo;s session (I&rsquo;ll have to catch that another time). Good fun session and really made me see the benefit of Style Cop &ndash; I shall be trying this product out more soon <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/wlEmoticon-smile_3.png" alt="Smile" /></p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>Great day with lots of good people and good sessions. I can&rsquo;t wait for DDD Scotland and DDD SouthWest this year. I will be at both! Massive thanks to all the team for the day and thanks to all the people who voted my session in! Got to meet loads of people I have been talking to on Twitter (too many to mention) but shame I couldn&#8217;t meet more. I&#8217;m gutted I couldn&#8217;t clone myself so I could have been to more talks but human cloning is a taboo topic&#8230;..</p>

Your phone is communicating with Google servers and setting up your 
account. This may take up to five minutes."</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<p>This was then followed by the message:</p><pre>"Can't establish a reliable data connection to the server.
This could be a temporary problem or your SIM card may not be provisioned 
for data services. If it continues, call Customer Care."</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<p>I&#8217;ve been racking my brains all day on how to fix this. I have Googled it and read all sorts of articles that suggest a factory reset will help. I really didn&#8217;t want to do that. I tried using Google talk and trying that – still nothing</p>
<p>I finally read that if i tried to sign into the build in YouTube application on my phone then it would work! I tried it – success!</p>
<p>What a ridiculous bug – in order to add a second Google mail account to my phone I had to sign into YouTube? This is the type of thing that will ruin an OS as its been a bug since early 2010. I&#8217;m sure i wouldn&#8217;t have had this trouble with a WP7</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am writing this post as a follow up to a post I wrote about <a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/post/Where-have-all-the-good-developers-gone.aspx" target="_blank">recruitment</a>. In that post I specifically asked for developers with passion. On reflection over the past few days, I felt I needed to actually think about what passion means to me. I <em>think</em> I&rsquo;m passionate about what I do. I say think because my definition for passion may be different to others.</p>
<h4>What do I feel passion is?</h4>
<p>Passion, for me, is about wanting to make a difference. Its about communication of ideas and feelings to my peers. In order to be able to communicate those ideas, they need to be researched. Passionate people tend to work hard and really get something good out of helping or working with others. So in essence Passion is a good attribute to have. It can also be bad though &ndash; passion can drive confrontations or dictatorial people. But unless this is malicious then it may only be because people have conflicting ideas.</p>
<p>I do believe that passion can really motivate people. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a positive attribute in software</p>
<h4>Why am I passionate?</h4>
<p>I absolutely love what I do for a living. i get a kick out of researching new things and finding out how these things help me. Scott Hanselman said in a <a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/post/1-0-2-fame-and-notoriety" target="_blank">podcast</a> -</p>
<p><strong>[When showing liquid nitrogen to people for the first time]</strong> <em>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s 2 kinds of people,&nbsp; there&rsquo;s like dude we have to freeze a banana and smash it on the ground. then there&#8217;s the other people in the world, which are like oh that&#8217;s interesting and then they walk away.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I certainly tend to think of myself as being in the first type. I love looking at new things and technology and I love bringing those new things to others around me &ndash; especially my team when I feel it would help. I love pushing myself outside of my comfort zone. Those who know me and have worked with me have seen that sometimes I can be confrontational but there&rsquo;s no malice in that at all, I can get &ldquo;hot headed&rdquo; since I truly believe what I try and bring to a team will help them even if people cannot see that at the time. As I get more experienced, my confrontational side is ebbing as I realise that others are passionate about their ideas too.</p>
<h4>So why do I want to work with passionate developers?</h4>
<p>I want to get better at what I do. The day I feel I know everything is the day I think my career in development may be over. I have realised there is way too much out there for everyone to learn. Therefore I want to work/surround myself with passionate people so we can share ideas together. As we share, we can truly understand a topic or a challenge.</p>
<p>These types of developers will push me outside my comfort zone to enhance my knowledge or figure out a solution. I understand this <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">will</span> may cause friction, but we are grownups so we can get over that factor - right?. I&rsquo;m hoping that passion in my colleagues combined with my own passion will help keep the team motivated about what they do!</p>
<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;m not living in a dream world! My recruitment drive continues&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
