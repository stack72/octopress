<p>So its been a while and since my last post i have moved on from my previous job. I was sad to go as i was there for 4 years but i needed to move on to further my career.</p>
<p>Since moving to my new place of work i have had to initially do the follow:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>restructure SVN</li>
<li>setup CI server [TeamCity]</li>
<li>move all unit tests to NUnit 2.5.5</li>
<li>automate builds</li>
<li>break code dependencies</li>
</ul>
<div>This has been a very good move for me as it has really let me get my teeth into my new work. I expect this new role to be a challenge that will set me in good standing for the further.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The only drawback of the new job is the fact i need to take the train everyday - ALL CHANGE PLEASE!!!</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
