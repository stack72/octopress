<p>Ok i have converted some of the solutions i use to run via Visual Studio 2010 RC. When trying to debug one today i came across this error</p>

<p>it was rather a strange one and i couldnt really work it out. this was a fresh solution upgrade to VS2010 RC. i followed the prompt when loading the solution to create the virtual directory in IIS</p>
<p>when i checked IIS it had set the application pool incorrectly for me</p>
<p><img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="/blog/images/2010/2/IIS.gif" alt="&lt;mce:script type=" /></p>
<p>simply setting the application pool in the image above to as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/2010/2/apppool.GIF" alt="" /></p>
<p>solved the problem. Hope this helps :)</p>
