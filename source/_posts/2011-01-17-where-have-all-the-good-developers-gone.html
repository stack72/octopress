title: "Where have all the good developers gone?"

<p>I have been trying to recruit now for a good few months and we don&rsquo;t seem to be having much luck. I&rsquo;m not asking for much in a developer &ndash; I not looking for an expert in any particular field, in fact I think I'm looking for just some core skills that a good mid-level/ senior developer should have.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what core skills I&rsquo;m looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASP.NET/ C# 3.5 -&nbsp; 4.0</li>
<li>LINQ2SQL or Entity Framework 4</li>
<li>Unit Testing Skills</li>
<li>WCF / Web Services</li>
</ul>
<p>Desirable skills I'd like:</p>
<ul>
<li>MVC 2 ( or 3)</li>
<li>Good grounding in Design Patterns</li>
<li>Agile Experience</li>
<li>Experience with Continuous Integration</li>
<li>Social media API Experience</li>
</ul>
<p>The desirables are just that &ndash; desirable! They are not required for this! There is 1 other thing that I really want in a developer &ndash; passion! I want a developer to enjoy what they do and to be able to work in a team that requires good knowledge share and good communication skills</p>
<p>I cannot find developers never mind the developers that fit the bill &ndash; am I looking for the wrong type of developer?&nbsp;I've been told that all the good developers have changed to be contractors - is this the case?&nbsp;Do the skills I require seem to be so far out of left field that developers don&rsquo;t have them? I&rsquo;m honestly stumped!!</p>
