<p>This past weekend (January 10th &ndash; 14th 2012) <a href="http://codemash.org">CodeMash</a> was held in the Kalahari resort in Sandusky, OH. Yes I know &ndash; Ohio in January!! I had been warned that firstly its cold there and secondly there is usually a lot of snow. This time we were quite lucky and only got a little snow. I arrived on Wednesday night after a very long journey and walked into what was just a hive of activity. I have been to a lot of conferences, this one was not only huge but very interactive and social. A lot of the attendees brought their families for the week!</p>

<p>I was very lucky to have a session accepted for this conference (Introducing Continuous Delivery) and was extremely pleased to know that my session had made it from over 700 applications. I was also lucky enough to have my session early on Thursday. If you look at the <a href="http://codemash.org/CodeMashSchedule.pdf">schedule</a>, marvel at the level of speakers here and you will see why I was so pleased!</p>
<p>The big thing for me on this conference is that there were a lot of companies there in force. <a href="http://edgecase.com/">Edgecase</a> and <a href="http://leandog.com/">Leandog</a> are the 2 that stick out for me. Edgecase as they were usually in the hot tub drinking and leandog because of those hats <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/wlEmoticon-smile_7.png" alt="Smile" />. There was also the small matter of a party on Thursday evening after the sessions that actually moved to take over the waterpark between 10pm and 1am. A-Maze-ing! I, in fact, did &lsquo;a <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/coreyhaines">Corey Haines&rsquo;</a> and smashed my head off the bottom of the pool. At one point on the Friday, Cleveland were trying to get me to stand on the runway as a beacon for the planes to find the runway as it was so red!</p>
<h5>a Corey Haines :</h5>
<ul>
<li>To injure oneself at CodeMash in the waterpark</li>
<li><em>OMG Dude you just did a Corey Haines &ndash; are you ok? </em></li>
</ul>
<ul>Oh and the bacon bar &ndash; bacon with all sorts of toppings available &ndash; from butterscotch to white chocolate.</ul>

<p>Without the <a href="http://codemash.org/Sponsors">sponsors</a> this event would never have been able to happen. Please do say a thank you &ndash; tweet them even! I seen tweets as to the magnitude of the event:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/codemash/status/155385899197276160">Just picked up cashier's check to Kalahari for partial conference payment: $330,000. Nice double-take from the cashier when I said amount</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most importantly, I would sincerely like to thank all the organisers. These guys work on this conference while holding down jobs. Its an incredible accomplishment. It was what I would certainly class as <strong>the best</strong> conference ever. Thinking of 1300 geeks in a waterpark in Ohio in January doesn&rsquo;t do this event justice at all. It is quite literally a software conference for the entire family.</p>
<p>I met so many cool people &ndash; I couldn't begin to name them all or acknowledge them all! I will certainly be back next year! For now I will have to get over the bacon sweats, keep icing my head from my stupidity and start working on my submission next year!</p>
