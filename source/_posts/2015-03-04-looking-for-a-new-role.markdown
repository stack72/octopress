EDIT: I am no longer looking for a new role. Thanks to all for the suggestions

TL;DR: I am looking for a new role. I am an infrastructure developer who has a passion for metrics, monitoring and alerting. If you feel that you are interested in me coming to help your engineering team, then get in contact with me

### I love working on infrastructure!
Over the past few years, I have helped transform a team who worked solely in the manual sysadmin space into the configuration management world. This has reduced the time taken to provision a server and get an application into production from a number of weeks, to a number of hours.

Metrics are a key part of my day to day work. I believe that if we don't measure it then we cannot improve on it and learn from it. I also love to know what is happening with my systems before getting a call from an end user telling me there is a problem.

I have a real drive to make the lives of the engineer teams I work with easier. This means that by helping to create better infrastructure practices, I am helping them and ultimately helping deliver more business value


### What type of company would I work for?
I have learned over the past few years that being part of a good company is the key to a happy work life. Culture, to me, is absolutely everything. I deeply care about what I do and I really want to be part of a company that holds these same values.

Remote work is something I am interested in, as long as the company is set up for it. I worked remotely a lot in 2014 and found it to be hugely productive as well as beneficial for my previous company because it allowed me to interact to a greater scale with the wider engineer community learning and sharing best practices to keep at the forefront of the industry. I therefore donâ€™t mind where in the world a company is based, but that company must value treating remote employees as importantly as those who are office based

### What about the role?

I want to be part of a team that care about the systems they create. Working on challenging problems brings out the absolute best in me, and being successful in this means the team I belong to is hugely important because every single person has a role to play in finding and implementing solutions. Working with a team of engineers who always want to improve themselves, their work, and support their colleagues, is what drives me and helps create a supportive team dynamic. Therefore I want to work with engineers who have a good work/life balance and love what they do as much as I do.

### What I definitely don't want to do

I don't want to be a ticket filler. I want to be involved in helping to shape infrastructure systems and helping to drive decisions going forward. In my opinion, automation is key to helping deliver great systems and I really want to be part of delivering those systems

### So hire me!
If your company is looking for passionate infrastructure developers who always want to improve or If your company has a need (and the willingness) to drive their infrastructure forward and improve then I could be the right person for you.
