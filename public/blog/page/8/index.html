  <div class="entry-content"><p>My current project at work sees me building an ASP.NET MVC3 project. When the project was being built initially, we had no idea of what the final schema of the database would look like. So we built the app using a fake dataset that we can in cache and read / wrote to that cache during the application. The decision was made that we would use Entity Framework 4 for our data access method and as we already had&nbsp; business entities in place, we thought that Code First would be a good way to go since it was in RC.</p>
<p>We didnt get our DBAs involved as the schema wasn&#8217;t completely finished. So we decided to use Sql Server CE 4. I know what you are thinking&nbsp; - MS Fan Boy, new technology freak &ndash; and you would be right. I&rsquo;m happy with what we have chosen and its worked for us. We have now managed to get a database schema that we are happy with.</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong> we hit a flaw when we looked at how we migrate our Sql Server CE 4 database to Sql Server. I know there are tools available but I didn&rsquo;t feel that I had a huge amount of control over these and I wanted one to be able to run from msbuild since I will (eventually) be automating the process.</p>
<p>Step up web deploy v2! I managed to find an article a while back that was tweeted by Sayed Hashim on the new features of web deploy v2. There is build in support for this exact purpose.&nbsp;So in order to run the process I opened a command line and change directory to the Web Deploy v2 folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\IIS\Microsoft Web Deploy V2). I can then run the command as follows:</p>
<p><strong>msdeploy      <br />-verb:sync       <br />-source:dbFullSql=&#8221;Data Source=&lt;path to .sdf&gt;&#8221;,ScriptData=false,sqlCe=true       <br />-dest:dbFullSql=&#8221;&lt;output .sql path&gt;&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>This is pretty self explanatory but the important parts are to include sqlCe = true as this will make msdeploy know its a sql compact edition database. ScriptData = false will mean that only the schema will be output and no data will be included. If this is omitted then the schema will be exported as well as the data.</p>
<p>When I run this i get something similar to this screen on my console:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_14.png"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_14.png" border="0" alt="image" width="598" height="101" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course this command can be included in a batch file and be executed from TeamCity (post coming soon on this!) or manually run when necessary.</p>
<p>The output of the script can be opened and run against Sql Server &ndash; or if you wait for my next post &ndash; to be used to create sql change scripts that can be used from continuous database deployment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>TeamCity has been proving to be one of the most useful tools I have used in recent times. It has helped me from continuous deployment of sites to staging and production environments,&nbsp; allowing security penetration testing, running automated acceptance tests with SpecFlow and much more. I really hoped there would be a way that I could test the SEO capabilities of a newly deployed site. Usually when I deploy a site I will open IIS console and run a Site Analysis against the URL using the <a href="http://www.iis.net/download/seotoolkit" target="_blank">SEO Toolkit</a> but I thought there must really be a way to run this from TeamCity.</p>
<p>Over the past week or so I have been writing some prototype code that will allow me to use the SEO toolkit dll to create a sits analysis. This worked out to be effective and since I was able to run the analysis from code I was able to run the application from TeamCity.</p>
<p>the code for this application is in very early stages as it was written with the help of some sample code on MSDN. It will evolve over time and I&rsquo;ll make this available. The plans for the application are to support different parts of the analysis to be added to the report by config parameters. As I am sure this code could be misused I have added a small Thread.Sleep so that it can&rsquo;t be used to DoS attack a site. I accept no responsibilities for the code being misused.</p>
<h3>Configuring TeamCity to Run the Application</h3>
<p>Log into TeamCity as an administrator and go into the administration screen.</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/CreateProject.jpg"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-width: 0px;" title="CreateProject" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/CreateProject_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="CreateProject" width="328" height="58" /></a></p>
<p>Click on &lsquo;Create Project&rsquo; and enter some project details:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/ProjectDetails.jpg"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-width: 0px;" title="ProjectDetails" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/ProjectDetails_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="ProjectDetails" width="326" height="80" /></a></p>
<p>Next we want to create a build configuration. So click on &lsquo;Create build configuration&rsquo;:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/CreateBuildConfiguration.jpg"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-width: 0px;" title="CreateBuildConfiguration" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/CreateBuildConfiguration_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="CreateBuildConfiguration" width="365" height="40" /></a></p>
<p>Add some general details &ndash; name, description and build number format. The most important thing to note here is the artifacts text area. It has SEOReport.html added to it. This is the report that the crawler application creates. We add this to the artifacts so that we can add the results to a report tab.</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/BuildSettings.jpg"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-width: 0px;" title="BuildSettings" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/BuildSettings_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="BuildSettings" width="325" height="173" /></a></p>
<p>We will be asked next to enter some VCS settings. I have had to hack things slightly. Technically I don&#8217;t have to check this application out of version control. So I enter the path to the application file in the checkout path as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/VCSSettings.jpg"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 0px;" title="VCSSettings" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/VCSSettings_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="VCSSettings" width="313" height="108" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build step is the next thing to add. In the build steps over click on Add Build Step and choose Command Line from the runner type drop down menu. This is where we call the application now:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/BuildStep.jpg"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 0px;" title="BuildStep" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/BuildStep_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="BuildStep" width="309" height="137" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see we leave the working directory empty as we have specified the directory already in the VCS stage. We can then call the .exe from the command executable. The parameters is where it gets interesting. This is were we pass in the site to scan &ndash; if a site is not specified then an application exception will be thrown and the build will fail.</p>
<p>When you have finished the setup and passed in a site then run the build. On a successful build the build details page will show (a newly configured) SEO Crawler Report tab:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/ReportTab.jpg"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 0px;" title="ReportTab" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/ReportTab_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="ReportTab" width="366" height="101" /></a></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know how to add a custom report tab I&rsquo;ll cover this in a separate post. But on the successful build and we click that tab we get a very simple report as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/ReportOutput.jpg"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 0px;" title="ReportOutput" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/ReportOutput_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="ReportOutput" width="295" height="321" /></a></p>
<p>This report only has a summary of URLS, links and violations as well as site status codes and broken links. But as this application provides a full scan that the SEO toolkit can do we can make the application output more details. In coming versions of the code, I&rsquo;ll allow it to be configurable as to which sections can be added to the report.</p>
<h3>How Can I View The Full Report?</h3>
<p>As I mentioned, the crawler application does a full site analysis. The same analysis that IIS does. In the application root folder an IIS SEO Reports folder. This folder will contain all the scan reports. So if you <strong>really</strong> want to you can take the scan folder and drop it to a know IIS location (for me is MyDocuments/IIS SEO Reports) and IIS can display the full report as it would have done before.</p>
<p>Another tip of the cap to TeamCity. I know as this is an executable it can be called from any build script but its just made very easy for me with the build in build runner and parameters acceptance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while back I made a post about an itme I wanted for Visual Studio 2010. The item I wanted was a tool to sync my installed extensions&#8217; between any machines that I used Visual Studio on. This wasn’t available, or so I though, but thanks to Latish Sehgal such a tool now exists. </p>  <p>The post on the tool can be found on his <a href="http://dotnetsurfers.com/blog/2011/03/14/extensionsync-a-visual-studio-extension-to-synchronize-other-extensions/" target="_blank">blog</a>. I think this is a tool that can be utilised from within teams and also for users who use multiple machines and installs of Visual Studio.</p>  <p>I’d like to thank Latish a lot for the tool! It has made the way I use Visual Studio much more uniform and that can only be a good thing!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I witnessed a real show of power of the <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/02/introducing-razor.aspx" target="_blank">Razor View engine</a> included with ASP.NET MVC3.</p>  <p>Traditionally in sites scripts and styles are all thrown in the masterpage (webforms) or sitelayout (razor). This can lead to pages taking potentially longer to load when they don&#8217;t even need some of the scripts or styles. As Google announced that page load times were going to be part of Google rankings, it’s not ideal for this to happen.</p>  <p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_11.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_11.png" width="609" height="188" /></a> </p>  <p>This has been made easier as Razor has introduced the ability to define sections in our pages.</p>  <p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_12.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_12.png" width="609" height="221" /></a> </p>  <p>The code here checks to see if a section of the required name is defined and if so it will render it.&#160; This can be used to encapsulate scripts and styles as shown. Here we load the site.css as this is required for the entire site and we load the jQuery main library as this will also be required all over the site. We can then define Sections in our sitelayout and render specific scripts and styles required for a specific View</p>  <p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_13.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_13.png" width="610" height="287" /></a> </p>  <p>This image shows that by then using the appropriate section named from the sitelayout page that we can play only the scripts required for that view in that section. This will help to make the views as lightweight as possible when they are being rendered.</p>  <p>This is a demonstration of the power of the Razor view engine. It just makes it very easy to achieve. I’m loving using MVC3 and feel as though things are not quite “right” when I go back to working on webforms projects! :(</p>  <p>Hope it helps!</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2011-03-15T00:00:00+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 15<span>th</span>, 2011</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Late last night (14th March 9PM PST), Microsoft released IE9 to the world (www.beautyoftheweb.com). I must begin by saying I didn&rsquo;t know this launch was happening which was strange as a release of this scale would usually be major news. I found out via <a href="http://twitter.com/ironshay" target="_blank">Shay Friedman</a> on Twitter. So IE9 was released, pretty huge eh? Finally a browser released by Microsoft to challenge the likes of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.</p>
<p>IE 9 was billed as a huge step forward in terms of browsers from Microsoft. It has HTML5 support, industry leading JavaScript speed and full hardware acceleration. It is supposedly very fast indeed! A browser I was certainly waiting for to rival my love for Google Chrome.</p>
<p>I have heard mixed stories about installation encounters from different people. Some people said that it asked them to close all programs and then installed fine, others suggested that it installed as normal then required a machine reboot. Why would a browser ever require a reboot of a machine for installation? In 2011 it seems like utter madness! Apparently its because it updates explorer.exe and requires a reboot because of that. I believe it&rsquo;s too tightly coupled to the operating system and that&rsquo;s why the reboot is required. I thought I&#8217;d install it anyway,</p>
<p>So I downloaded the correct version (x64 or x86). I started the installation process. At this point I had 2 instances of Visual Studio 2010 open. I also had Seesmic Desktop 2, Spotify, Google chrome and various instances of SVN, TeamCity Tray monitor and Skype. I thought I&rsquo;d be prompted to close all the applications but I wasn&rsquo;t. I feared a reboot! At the end of the installation my worst fears were realised! Reboot required &ndash; in the middle doing some work on a personal project. As you can imagine I was pretty annoyed.</p>
<p>Apart from the required reboot, the product itself looks like. On first glance it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a game changer for me. I&rsquo;m a huge fan of chrome as its so slick and I love their upgrade process so I think for the foreseeable future I&rsquo;ll be sticking with that. But speaking about upgrade processes lets talk about versions of IE.</p>
<p>Currently In the market we have IE6, IE7, IE8 and now IE9. I realise that other pieces of software have got different versions around at the minute. I also know that there are many different versions of Firefox around at the minute. But those who protest that have NEVER tried to support all the major different browsers for design. As huge corporate and government organisations still use IE6 &ndash; it can still be classed as a major browser. The differences between IE6 and IE7 in terms of design rendering was huge. IE8 then introduced compatibility mode. There is no real backwards compatibility in my opinion. Designing a site for IE8 may not render correctly in IE6 so I really dread seeing an IE9 designed site in IE6.</p>
<p>I understand that Microsoft will never be able to keep everyone happy. I appreciate the efforts made in the design of IE9 and I will certainly give it a shot rather than just say it&rsquo;s not for me. But I would rather some effort be put into killing off some of the older versions of IE before IE10 is released. I don&rsquo;t think I could cope with 5 versions :)</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t designed as a rant &ndash; I applaud Microsoft for pushing their products onwards. But I really do feel that <strong>we</strong> need to help Microsoft by killing off older browsers. Make our own lives easier please! Currently I can count 13 different browsers while sitting on a train. Lets make that number decrease before new ones are added.</p>
<p>p.s. Microsoft please please please bear in mind user gripes when designing IE10 so that it doesn&rsquo;t require a reboot. We are in the 21st century ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When installing Teamcity plug-ins, you need to find out what version of TeamCity the plugin was designed for. This will more than likely be stated on the supporting documentation on the TeamCity confluence site. Lets use the <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/TW/PowerShell" target="_blank">Powershell plugin</a> as an example as that is designed for Teamcity 6.x</p>
<p>In order to install this plugin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the .zip </li>
<li>
<div>Open a command line and go to TeamCity bin folder</div>
<ul>
<li>
<div>(C:\Program Files (x86)\JetBrains\TeamCity\bin)</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<div>Run the command: runAll.bat stop</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Go to the build server plug-ins folder</div>
<ul>
<li>
<div>(C:\Program Files (x86)\JetBrains\TeamCity\buildServer\plugins)</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<div>Drop the .zip file into the folder</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Go back to the command line and restart the TeamCity build server: runAll.bat start</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The build agent will then load the plugin. Hope it helps :)</p>

I’m really pleased at this and am very much looking forward to presenting it. I haven’t got a chance to see the full schedule yet but I know of a few other sessions that were selected.</p>  <p>I’m disappointed I won’t get to present my more advanced TeamCity talk there but I will try for another conference for that. Who knows maybe I’ll finally get my workshop up and running for it!</p>  <p>If you are interested in going to this <strong>free</strong> event run for the community, by the community then registration opens on march 14th 2011 at 1230pm (GMT).

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while back I wrote a post on what passion means to me. Someone asked me to discuss how I achieved a work / life balance so I thought I&rsquo;d write this post while on holiday (ironic eh!)</p>
<p>So, as someone who believes they have passion, I guess i can be described as working a lot. This doesn&rsquo;t just mean my day job but it means studying/reading new things, writing code of my own for research applications or helping others with development related tasks. I read a lot of development books as well so I&rsquo;m sure this can really eat into my time.</p>
<p>I personally think that definitions of disconnecting and developer burnout&nbsp; are subjective. But even more, each developer has their own way or preventing burnout and from disconnecting from their life as a developer. I am absolutely addicted to twitter and I am on there an awful lot. I don&rsquo;t feel that when I&rsquo;m on twitter that I&rsquo;m working or engaging in work. Certainly it can make me talk about work but I don&rsquo;t generally have Visual Studio open while I&rsquo;m on there. This, to me, means that twitter isn&rsquo;t really stopping me from disconnecting. I use it more as a social networking tool &ndash; to talk to other developers who can help me, to bookmark articles for use later when I am on my laptop.</p>
<p>So what is disconnecting to me? I feel that it&rsquo;s when I don&rsquo;t writing code, don&rsquo;t do overtime at work, don&rsquo;t look at emails and generally don&rsquo;t do any development related tasks. I can still tweet &ndash; twitter is facebook for geeks so tweeting is just being social! Disconnecting goes hand in hand with trying to prevent myself burning out. Burning out is doing far too much &ndash; this can stem from working too many hours or working strange or anti-social hours. This can cause slight depression in some cases or problems at home. First stage of burnout to me is when I cannot sleep because all I can think about is my work or my projects.</p>
<p>Burnout I&rsquo;m told can be a bit of a killer to a developer. Burnout can occur when a developer works too much. This can be overtime for day job or can be working late hours on a personal project. I don&rsquo;t feel I have been &ldquo;burnt out&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m honestly not in a position to say this. I&rsquo;m sure my girlfriend would be a better judge of this. In order to try and stay away from burnout I tend to try and have 3 nights a week away from work related activities. During this time I still tweet (but hey its on my phone so its ok ;)) but I don&rsquo;t actively do any development related activities unless they are classed as incredibly urgent. My girlfriend and my dog are the things that keep me focused way from work when I&rsquo;m on a &ldquo;night off&rdquo;. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll continue to not be 100% workaholic but as my job changes or new things happen or are released in the development work things may change. Lets just hope that I can be strong and not give up all my free time!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past month I have volunteered to help out in the creation of some <a href="http://nuget.org" target="_blank">nuget</a> packages. The packages I said I&rsquo;d help with are NUnit and Simple.Data. I volunteered as I have a dedi box and wanted to try and script it from my TeamCity installation.</p>
<p>In order to get the projects working I have created a custom MSBuild script that does things in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build </li>
<li>Zip </li>
<li>Package </li>
<li>Nuget Creation </li>
</ul>
<ul>
This was all thanks to help from <a href="http://www.jeremyskinner.co.uk" target="_blank">Jeremy Skinner</a>. Jeremy has managed to do all the steps above&nbsp; as part of his build but chooses to run the push to nuget.org from a powershell script. manually so he can make sure it never happens unexpectedly. I am very much a fan of automation. Therefore I wanted to find a way to automate this push to nuget as part of a specific build configuration. Out of the box, TeamCity has no powershell build runner. In order to try to execute the powershell script, I was wrapping the call in a .cmd file. But this was not working fantastically and was hanging and throwing errors for me. 
</ul>
<ul>
I managed to find a <a href="http://teamcity.jetbrains.net/viewType.html?buildTypeId=bt268&amp;tab=buildTypeStatusDiv" target="_blank">Powershell TeamCity plugin</a> (login as a guest to see it). This allowed a build step to be added to TeamCity config that execute Powershell scripts directly and therefore helps to automate the process. 
</ul>
<p>When this script is installed I see the following in my TeamCity build runner menu</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_10.png"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_10.png" border="0" alt="image" width="330" height="198" /></a></p>
<p>A simple call to the correct .ps1 file means the publish to nuget! Hope this helps</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the xmas period I read a book I have wanted to for a while now, <a href="http://www.manning.com/hay/" target="_blank">Azure in Action</a>. I didn&rsquo;t know anything at all about the cloud. In fact, my thoughts were that you could take an existing application and host it in &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; without any real thought process. This turned out to be incorrect.</p>
<p>The authors help the reader to see the power of Azure. They also help to describe what Azure actually is and it&rsquo;s structure. The book also describes how items are stored (using BLOBs) and how this compares to the normal means of storage (SAN, DFS etc.)</p>
<p>The most impressive thin I learned from reading this book, was how the different roles on Azure work. The decisions required for scalability of our application help to drive decisions based on the amount of roles required and the ability to scale out or scale up.</p>
<p>The book also talks about the API&rsquo;s required for dealing with the storage mechanisms and how you can interact with these APIs both inside and outside of the Azure platform.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So what do I learn from this book?</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, simple, a lot. I learned that I cannot just host my existing service in the cloud &ndash; I need to think more about my application, e.g. trust levels, its state, storage etc. I also need to think about configuration as a web.config cannot be changed on the fly like a normal web application. The use of the service definition files mean the application can potentially become more flexible as configuration can be shared between azure and non-azure environments.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Would I recommend this book to a friend?</span></strong></p>
<p>Without a doubt! I&rsquo;d thoroughly recommend this book. This book is suitable for those that know very little about Azure but really want to learn about it but want to see what Azure actually is and how to start using it. I enjoyed this book so much I&rsquo;m hoping that a new version will be created to show the changes in Azure that were announced at PDC2010.</p>
<p>Thanks to the authors, Chris Hay and Brian Prince for a well written book, also thanks to Manning books for publishing it!</p>
