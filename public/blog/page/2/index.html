  <div class="entry-content"><p>The date is 1st August 2012. Developers have been wondering for weeks when the release of VS2012 and ASP.NET 4.5 will happen. Somasegar, cvp of dev div in Microsoft, has just <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2012/08/01/visual-studio-2012-and-net-4-5-complete.aspx" target="_blank">announced that the final build version of VS2012 is complete</a>.This means the product is ready for release. Dot net developers all over the world are eagerly waiting for the immortal words, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s available to download on MSDN&rdquo;. Unfortunately they haven&rsquo;t come. Instead, the download will not show up for another 14 days. This seems wasteful to me.</p>
<p>Tell me if I am incorrect, but I believe the delay is that the product has gone to tool vendors to make sure that their tools / plugins will work with the application. This to me seems a very strange thing to do. This product has technically been in the making for 18 months (since the release of VS2010) so giving it to vendors in the final 2 weeks is crazy. What will happen if the vendors report it doesn&rsquo;t work with their tools? Would Microsoft stop a release for this considering it is so baked into the windows 8 release? I don&rsquo;t think there is any possibility of that happening at all. Therefore why the delay? I understand that 3rd party vendors are customers that Microsoft have to satisfy, but technically so are we &ndash; the users of the product.</p>
<p>My ethos on software delivery is ship early, ship often. I hate when a feature is complete that it has to wait around for 2 weeks before release. Get the product out there, start gathering feedback and get planning to deliver more value to that customer. I understand that VS2012 is not easy to release often. Its a rather large download and there are pricing models around it. But changing the shape of the product to delivery in small chunks that are updatable more often would allow the product to get shaped by its user base. Faster feedback means delivering more customer value. It seems that other departments within Microsoft are now following this model (MVC team, EF team and Nuget team). Delivering like this is becoming more popular (and hopefully will become the standard). Its time to embrace this ethos Microsoft. Its certainly how I would be looking at things in the future if I were the product lead developer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In traditional, waterfall organisations, a development team follows the organisation hierarchy. The development team can be split into smaller sub teams and each of those teams can have their own leader, but ultimately the hierarchy still exists. Developers usually stay in that sub team for most of their time in the organisation and they know exactly who their line manger is and who is responsible for their reviews and can act accordingly. The organisational structure is rigid and embedded into the process of the team and organisation.</p>
<p>In more agile teams, the organisational structure is less rigid meaning that developers do not need to stay in a single sub team for their time at the company. They can be organised (or organise themselves in more advanced agile cultures) into teams based on skills. New developers are hired with a view to how they can benefit the wider team and not towards the skills needed for a sub team in a waterfall environment. Even though there are less restrictions on people moving between teams, it is not always guaranteed. It can happen when required, e.g. when a new member of staff is hired and the skillsets need to be spread evenly. This can evolve further.</p>
<h4>Can agile teams be formed around projects?</h4>
<p>Simply, yes. This is actually how projects work at Facebook. When a developer joins the company, they can request what team they want to join when their &lsquo;boot camp&rsquo; is over. Each developer has a desk and that desk is on wheels. Their office is completely open plan. When a team&rsquo;s project is finished, the developers simply break up as a unit and wheel their desks to form the next team for the next project.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to a few people about this fluid team structure. All responses seem to follow the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a developer continually moves around, who is the manager responsible for the developers review?</li>
</ul>
<p>At school, I was part of a form group and I had a form tutor. This was the class I was part of each morning between 0900 and 0910 and where registration would be taken. I didn&rsquo;t study all my subjects with that class or that tutor. Each teacher had their own area of expertise. I moved around when I needed to go to a class. The same can happen in the workplace. In an agile team there should not be any need to micromanage members of the team. Just because you don&rsquo;t sit beside your line manager doesn&rsquo;t mean they cannot manage you. They need to form a trusting and communicative relationship with each other &ndash; characteristics of an agile team. This will allow the manager to know exactly how the developer is progressing and any obstacles in their way.</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens if a project ends up with all the weakest developers in a development department?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are happy to hire weak developers then I suggest a look at your hiring process may be a useful thing to do. If a developer is not hired because they have the correct attitude, skillset and cultural fit for your team or you are happy to hire the &lsquo;best of a bad bunch&rsquo;&nbsp; then you may have bigger issues than worrying about the formation of sub teams.</p>
<p>To summarise, you don&rsquo;t need to keep developers locked to a team or a line manager. A trusting and communicative environment should always allow the team to focus on what they were hired for, the delivery of software. After all, if you are not here to care about the quality and standard of your work, then you should really think about changing career and stop wasting your employers money.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a huge advocate of continuous integration and continuous delivery. I am always cautious about mentioning continuous deployment in my talks. This <strong>can</strong>, I stress the word can, be dangerous. For me there is a journey in the delivery of software.</p>  <ul>   <li>Companies, traditionally, started slow and go with manual deployments infrequently </li>    <li>Continuous Integration was introduced to the team when the team grew and needed to help test the integration of their code </li>    <li>The need to deploy more frequently may arise and as manual deployments are time consuming and (or) painful, deployments become automated </li>    <li>Continuous delivery was then said to be the better way to develop software (this meaning that code in the master repo is always in a state where it can be released to the end user) </li> </ul>  <p>This journey not only required a development teams skillset to grow to support it, but it also required a culture and attitude change as we move through the lifecycle. Developers need to start taking more care in their work and making sure that technical debt is not accrued too fast and that work is tested thoroughly. For me, when a team reaches this maturity point, they have reached the pinnacle of software delivery. The time required to release a new feature (cycle time) is determined by how fast the developer can develop and test the feature rather than worrying about release cycles. A release for this individual can be created and scheduled as appropriate to the needs of the business. The process is almost completely automated.</p>  <p>Lets take the step to continuous deployment. This is where every successful build is released to the end user. For me, things start to get a bit scary here. Continuous deployment is associated with start-ups. Companies that are releasing a new product and need to get it to market fast to get revenue and user feedback. As the codebase is young, it would has accrued less technical debt so the cycle time would potentially be faster than companies with legacy code. I believe that continuous deployment needs to be surrounded by rigorous automated testing (unit, integration, acceptance, system, performance etc..) and also supported by an immune system that helps to notify everyone if key performance or conversion metrics etc. drop below certain thresholds. This would help the confidence in the code being released to be as high as possible. In this type of environment, developers should work with the operations staff to make sure that deployments happen and follow up if there are issues with the release. I cannot stress enough that continuous deployment should not be taken lightly. It *will* come back and bit you on the ass if you are not well prepared.</p>  <p>Imagine my surprise when I read on twitter during the (azure announcement name hashtag) that the new version of TFS will support continuously deploying applications to the new azure portal [THIS NEEDS CHECKED FOR ACCURACY]. Firstly, I was surprised that this feature was added to TFS over something more useful, e.g. DVCS style version control. The lack of the good version control is a major downfall in TFS for me. Secondly, I think that this new feature will inspire a new breed of false bravery. I understand that it is very good to be brave. Nothing is braver than finishing development fast and pushing straight to production. There needs to be a process around these deployments – are they dark deployments, canary releases, have A/B testing etc.? Have you got the performance test analysis incase your feature causes an issue in production that costs the company money. Have you got monitoring around the system to spot potential issues early. There are many things I have set up around my continuous deployment sites.I don’t believe that all software developers give enough thought to what they are doing and will fix it later. Continuous deployment may not be good for these types of developer. A small issue unnoticed, e.g. a missing ‘checkout’ button on the site, can cause the company a lot of money. </p>  <p>I am by no way trying to say my setup is better than other developer setups, I am merely pointing out that a good support network around a deployment is needed. Maybe azure has this good support network but a developer should definitely know how to use it if they are to take advantage of this feature. If you are working on a personal project that doesn’t affect too much then continuously deploy until your heart is content. If wanting to take the giant leap to this in a company with legacy code then think twice. don’t f**k with your users. They potentially pay your salary. I think TFS should focus on making the tool easier to use for developers rather than worry about continuous deployment just yet</p>  <p>&lt;/TFSRant&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I always had the idea that the term &lsquo;burnout&rsquo; had a pretty standard meaning in software development. I&rsquo;m sure each developer have their own way of phrasing it but in essence, I was always of the idea that it meant &lsquo;over working leading to exhaustion and lack of motivation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I wanted to see what the exact thoughts of my peers was so asked on twitter &ldquo;what does burnout meant to you?&rdquo;. I got a list of varied responses:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/tomasmcguinness" target="_blank">@tomasmcguinness</a>: <em>Burnout in terms of software development? For me, it means losing the ability to concentrate and focus,combined with mental fatigue</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/mbrit" target="_blank">@mbrit</a>: <em>For me, it&#8217;s about ending up at a dead end in terms of stimulation/career progress.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/kristofclaes" target="_blank">@kristofclaes</a>: <em>&#8220;I should have kept this as a hobby&#8230;&#8221; or something like that. Not sure how to put it into words.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/jcmm33" target="_blank">@jcmm33</a>: <em>whatever the cause, its a lack of focus/motivation/drive/engagement within an employee when there used to be</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/nathangloyn" target="_blank">@NathanGloyn</a>: <em>burnout = not able to work any more, nervous breakdown, catastrophic event</em></p>
<p>These are only a few of the responses, but as you can see the vary a lot. The reason I asked this question is that whilst on a trip to San Francisco recently, I was able to catch a company organised talk from <a href="http://www.facebook.com/jayp" target="_blank">Jay Parikh</a>, the VP of Infrastructure at Facebook. I don&rsquo;t need to tell you who Facebook are therefore you can imagine I was very interested to hear his thoughts on the subject. Whilst talking to us, Jay spoke about Facebook hack-a-thons. Basically their entire team (product owners, devs, IT guys etc.) get together on a night of the week in the Facebook campus and work on something they don&#8217;t normally work on.</p>
<p>One of our developers asked the question, &ldquo;how do your devs avoid burnout when approaching hack-a-thons in the middle of a work week?&rdquo;. Jay discussed that development at Facebook wasn&rsquo;t a strict 9 &ndash; 5 culture and that developers would work the hours that they felt quite at home with. He said the developers at Facebook don&rsquo;t suffer burnout as <em>&ldquo;burnout is loosing interest in a project or piece of work&rdquo;</em> and their developers work for a maximum of 12 months in a team before moving to another.</p>
<p>I can see Jay&rsquo;s point but I don&rsquo;t feel that working too much and losing interest on a project are mutually exclusive. I think if you work too much then you can become bogged down in feeling a bit frustrated in your work. This can create boredom and make you lose interest and (or) focus. This is where I think burnout creeps in. This is what we need to make sure we avoid when we plan work. I usually associate burnout with long waterfall projects.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whilst upgrading our TeamCity server from 6.5 to 7.x, I encountered an error:</p>
<p><em>Unexpected error occurred inside Alarm task: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded</em></p>
<p>After a bit of looking around and sifting through some very weird articles I was able to find some good information on this. Basically, the JVM starts by default with 512mb of memory and it was struggling to process our 300+ build configurations with this. In order to fix it I had to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to TeamCity webserver</li>
<li>Open CMD</li>
<li>cd &lt;TeamCity root dir&gt;</li>
<li>cd bin</li>
<li>teamcity7w.exe //ES//TeamCity
<ul>
<li>If you are on TeamCity 6.x then you need to run teamcity6w.exe rather than ..7w</li>
</ul>
</li>
This will open the following dialog:</ul>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_51.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_49.png" alt="image" width="244" height="233" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Go to the Java tab and change the maximum memory pool entry to something other than 512mb</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_52.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_50.png" alt="image" width="244" height="233" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Restart the service and all should be well with the application start-up.</p>

For version 1, the application will only give you the opportunity to see your projects, builds types, last 10 builds of each build type and then link to the build on your teamcity server. This is only an initial release and will be followed up with the ability to trigger builds.</p>
<p>The application looks as follows:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while back I had to use <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/" target="_blank">JQuery mobile</a> for a project. The project needed to have 2 themes on an application and the configuration would need to tell the application what theme to load. With JQuery Mobile, the theme string could only be a single letter. I like keeping to decent and meaningful naming conventions, so I created a configuration setting as follows:</p>
<p>&lt;add key=&#8221;Theme&#8221; value=&#8221;Plain&#8221; /&gt;</p>
<p>I could see easily that the theme for this build of the application is the Plain theme. How could I relate that back to a JQuery theme? Plain would not be acceptable with JQuery Mobile. Therefore I had to do something different. I was able to use an attribute on the Theme Enum:</p>

<p>I then overrode the WebViewPage to include logic to get the Theme as follows:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/cdd00afc29b4b4599ebb.js"></script>
<p>As you can see, I have an extension method in place to get the string value of the enum. This then taps back into my String attribute as follows:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/94a594f634ee0aa1e3ae.js"></script>
<p>This then allowed me to turn a simple readable string from a web.config, into something that JQuery Mobile could understand and parse as normal</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am fed up with reading more and more posts, mostly on twitter, telling me I&rsquo;m wrong if I&rsquo;m doing it this way or wrong if I&rsquo;m not using this tool. Who gives you the right to tell me I am not correct? You do not know my problem space, domain or the criteria I need to work towards.</p>
<p>I have to say that this post is not in retaliation to anyone telling me I am doing something wrong. It is based towards all the posts titled &lsquo;You&rsquo;re doing it wrong&hellip;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In my opinion, we are continually learning in this industry. Something you may be good at now, may not be the hot topic in 6 months time. I am not sure there is a single person who knows <strong>*everything*</strong>. You may have your niche of expertise and you may be able to help but be constructive. If you really think I am doing it wrong, then give me reasons why so and point out the flaws in my way. It isn&rsquo;t black and white. This is not a math problem &ndash; there may be more than 1 way to do something.</p>
<p>I do a lot of speaking to groups about continuous integration &amp; delivery. There is no way I would tell someone they are wrong. Instead, all I can do is to put the reasons out there for my way of doing something. If the person takes this on-board then that&#8217;s fantastic. If they don&#8217;t, I won&#8217;t get offended. Maybe we should focus on helping the devs who are supposedly doing it wrong rather than pointing that almighty finger at them. Who knows, you may even learn something yourself.</p>
<p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had this idea to create a dashboard that would ping different version of a site in order to get the build number. The details are as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mysite.com">www.mysite.com</a></p>
<p>runs on a local site at 192.x.x.x, a QA environment at 10.x.x.x, a staging environment at 66.x.x.x, and a live environment at 88.x.x.x (these IPs are made up). In order to hit each site, I would usually manually change the host file and then make the web request. This was not a great solution as I hate dealing with host file entries. On experimenting with HTTPWebRequest, I noticed that you can use reflection in order to change the Headers of the Request. The normal code to create a HTTPWebRequest would look as follows:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/17bf91700d77d25c2435.js"></script>
<p>I was able to spoof the host by changing the host using reflection:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/5eb2fcb26600cd81416c.js"></script>
<p>This allowed me to make multiple requests to different versions of the same site. Using a simple collection of my site objects to build a dashboard that had the following outline:</p>
<table style="width: 574px;" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="116">&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top" width="118">Local</td>
<td valign="top" width="110">QA</td>
<td valign="top" width="113">Stage</td>
<td valign="top" width="115">Live</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="115">Build Number</td>
<td valign="top" width="118">web_12_4_qa</td>
<td valign="top" width="111">web_12_4_qa</td>
<td valign="top" width="114">web_12_5_stg</td>
<td valign="top" width="116">web_12_4_prod</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had to refactor some very old code a while back. The code looked similar to this:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/02f6a05870b5b2dd277f.js"></script>
<p>I had to refactor it so that I could add more parts to it. There was no way I could add in more case statements so it all had to go. I took a cautious approach to the refactoring as it was pretty brittle and quite important code. The first step in refactoring made the code look as follows:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/e263574855d5dc9b19fd.js"></script>
<p>This mean that I could make sure that the function of the code didn&rsquo;t change but that it was easier to read. This still couldn&rsquo;t be unit tested though as there was no way to mock the behaviour of the case statements &ndash; it was all still in the same class. The next refactoring step was to allow some unit tests to be written. I was able to separate the behaviours into their own class and made the code look as follows:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/ce53ce246dcf5f9bcaaa.js"></script>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t enough for me. I still had this huge switch statement that was breaking the <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/ocp.pdf" target="_blank">Open / Closed principle</a>. This meant that in order to add more functionality to the switch, I had to change the switch and risk breaking it. This couldn&rsquo;t happen. This made my final part of the code look as similar:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/843ed2eeaf5fab2e3c7f.js"></script>
<p>With this code I could make sure that I could write some unit tests around the behaviour of the class. This post only talks about going this far. I have since refactored the TaskRunner class much more as it was doing a lot more than 1 thing and thus breaking <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/srp.pdf" target="_blank">SRP</a>. How would you have handled the same refactoring?</p>
