<p>I am very pleased to be able to write this blog post! <a href="http://givecamp.org" target="_blank">GiveCamp</a> is an event in the USA that was founded to bring developers together to help out charity. It has been running successfully there since 2007.</p>
<p>Late in 2010, <a href="http://twitter.com/rachelhawley" target="_blank">Rachel Hawley</a> had the idea to try and bring GiveCamp to the UK. Through sheer hard work and determinism it&rsquo;s happening and today we are proud to release our new GiveCamp UK site:</p>
<p><a title="www.givecamp.org.uk" href="http://stack72.me/mH49Dj"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 0px initial initial;" title="www.givecamp.org.uk" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_26.png" border="0" alt="www.givecamp.org.uk" width="261" height="166" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Why did we choose the October 21 - 23?</strong> Its the date of the National GiveCamp in the US!&nbsp;What will you be doing on the weekend of October 21 &ndash; 23? I know what I will be doing. You should come along! We could all be part of something very special in the UK. Special thanks goes to Gareth Barker at <a href="http://www.uniondigitalmedia.co.uk" target="_blank">Union Digital Media</a> for helping with the design of the site. Already people have signed up to contribute &ndash; thanks to <a href="http://leankitkanban.com" target="_blank">Leankitkanban</a>, <a href="http://saasmadeeasy.com" target="_blank">SaaSMadeEasy</a>, <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>, <a href="http://hasbean.co.uk" target="_blank">HasBean</a> and <a href="http://discountasp.net" target="_blank">DiscountASP.NET</a>.
