<p>I was recently referred to <a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/EasyHttp" target="_blank">EasyHTTP</a> by it&rsquo;s creator, <a href="http://twitter.com/hhariri" target="_blank">Hadi Hariri</a>. Hadi was looking at some code I had sent him regarding my work with the <a href="http://jetbrains.com/teamcity" target="_blank">TeamCity</a> REST API and thought that things could be a little easier and less verbose.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/13bd7e958c74e45280f7.js"></script>
<p>In summary my application creates a new HttpWebRequest passing in the request type as a magic string. It opens a stream to read the JSON response and that JSON is then de-serialised to an entity. It was very messy. In order to call this class from my application I would have had to do the follow:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dde8df43b79f7200c517.js"></script>
<p>There is absolutely no mention of whether the request was a GET never mind a PUT or a DELETE. This is where EasyHTTP came in for me.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/bfef5d881c07f748eca5.js"></script>
<p>I was able to make a generic method for a GET request. This method takes a url and a type and with the help of <a href="http://jsonfx.net/" target="_blank">JsonFx</a>, de-serialises the response back to the requested type. THis was a great way to take the hassle out of my old code where I was creating a Url, calling a request and then de-serialising it. The code in the calling class now looks as follows:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/9ef7d6c027f865b7a8cc.js"></script>
<p>I was originally using the <a href="http://james.newtonking.com/pages/json-net.aspx" target="_blank">Newtonsoft JSON library</a> for my de-serialising my JSON back to types and to do that I had to decorate the properties with code similar to the following:</p>
<p>[JsonProperty(PropertyName = "id")]<br /> public string Id {get; set;}</p>
<p>This would effectively map a piece of JSON to a property that was not named <strong>exactly</strong> the same. EasyHTTP took care of this for me as well. To quote Hadi, EasyHTTP handles mapping as follows:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;For mapping properties, it handles camelcase, lowercase and a bunch of other conventions. You can also specify explicitly&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Using EasyHTTP, I was able to cut at least 2 lines of code per method in the client code. I was also able to delete an attribute that was present on <strong>all properties in the entities</strong> in a little bit of work.</p>
<p>The added distinction of creating the notion of GETs, PUTs and DELETE calls from each other mean that my class can be extended much easier. Hadi has written a post on EasyHTTP on <a href="http://hadihariri.com/2011/01/16/easyhttp/" target="_blank">his blog</a>. I would strongly suggest reading this and discovering if you can use this application in place of old HttpWebRequest calls. Its cleaner and helps to make code a little bit more DRY. My thanks to Hadi (and any contributors there may be) for making my work in this area a little easier!</p>
