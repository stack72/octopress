<p>This week my tool of the week is Console. This is an application that allows the hosting of different shell types all under 1 application.</p>  <p>I can have different tabs open in the application and each tab can relate to a different shell type as follows:</p>  <p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/tabs.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="tabs" border="0" alt="tabs" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/tabs_thumb.png" width="244" height="71" /></a> </p>  <p>This is very useful for me as I use Ruby command prompt a lot and use pinned icons to my Win 7 taskbar.</p>  <p>Its simple to add new shell types. Edit &gt; Settings </p>  <p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/settings.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="settings" border="0" alt="settings" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/settings_thumb.png" width="244" height="162" /></a> </p>  <p>then add a new tab and complete the details. The last part of the application that I really like is the improved copy and paste functionality. There is a right click context menu that has the following options:</p>  <p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/rightclick.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="rightclick" border="0" alt="rightclick" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/rightclick_thumb.png" width="244" height="182" /></a> </p>  <p>In my opinion its a fantastic product and its OSS. Check it out from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/" target="_blank">sourceforge</a>. This is a definite 5/5 and has made my development environment a lot more company.</p>
