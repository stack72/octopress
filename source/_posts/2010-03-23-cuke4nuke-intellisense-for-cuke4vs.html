<p>Needed to blog about this fantastic tool addin for VS2008 that gives intellisense for .feature files</p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/henritersteeg/cuke4vs">http://github.com/henritersteeg/cuke4vs</a></p>
<p>This gives intellisense as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/2010/3/intell.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also gives us the option to add a .feature file when adding a new item to a solution, as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/2010/3/feature.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One last beautiful feature of this tool is that when in the feature file and on a scenario step, then by pressing F12 you will be taking to the correct method in the class where it is matched.</p>
<p>The nice thing about this tool is that its free. Im not sure if there are any plans to incorporate this into VS2010 but if not id love to help out with this.</p>

<p>Anyone who uses <a href="http://github.com/richardlawrence/Cuke4Nuke">cuke4nuke</a> from visual studio should use this little adding</p>
