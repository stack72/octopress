<p>I really like MacOSX and am not a fan that it cannot run natively on my laptop. There my laptop now looks as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_6.png"><img style="display: inline; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_6.png" border="0" alt="image" width="535" height="303" /></a></p>
<p>After seeing this a few people have asked where I got the theme from. Here are the steps to recreate it:</p>
<p>1. Basically I took a MaxOSX Win 7 theme that was already created -&nbsp; <a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/downloads/Mac OS X Snow Leopard for Windows 7.zip" target="_blank">available here</a> - (rehosted by me as first was available after you took surveys etc)</p>
<p>2. After that was installed and working I installed <a href="http://files.punklabs.com/RocketDock/RocketDock-v1.3.5.exe" target="_blank">RocketDock</a></p>
<p>3. Configure RocketDock</p>
<p>4. Enjoy MacOSX theme :)</p>
<p>(PS i have got a full max OSX theme including shell extensions and new icon packs for Windows but its a risky install process &ndash; if you want it then let me know)</p>
