<p>I found out that my session on &ldquo;<strong>SpecFlow - functional testing made easy</strong>&rdquo; was selected for inclusion on the DDD Southwest agenda for June 11 2011.&nbsp; This has made all 3 DDD events so far this year for me which I am very happy about :) More information about my talk can be found on this blog on my <a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/page/Public-Speaking.aspx" target="_blank">public speaking page</a></p>
<p>DDD Southwest registration opens on April 12th at 10am &ndash; Go to <a href="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/">http://www.dddsouthwest.com/</a> and register as it will prove to be a great day judging by some of the talks I know that are selected. If you want to see the agenda before you sign up then you can find that one the <a href="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/Agenda/tabid/55/Default.aspx" target="_blank">dddsw site</a> as well</p>
