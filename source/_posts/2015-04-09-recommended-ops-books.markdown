I created a Github repo to store all the book recommendations I have had since moving more into the operations space. The book categories (so far), include:

* DevOps / Culture
* Continuous Delivery
* Systems Thinking
* Web Operations
* System Architecture
* Tooling

I want this repository to continue to grow with a list of links to books that people would recommend. If you feel you want to make some recommendations, then please feel free to send a PR!

Otherwise, enjoy the [suggestions](https://github.com/stack72/ops-books)
