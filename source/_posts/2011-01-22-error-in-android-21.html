<p>I have today just set up a Google Apps account to replace my old email addresses as they have started spamming consistently. So I wanted to add my Google apps account to my Samsung Galaxy S but when going to Gmail and trying to add an account it was telling me:</p><pre>"Signing in... 
Your phone is communicating with Google servers and setting up your 
account. This may take up to five minutes."</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<p>This was then followed by the message:</p><pre>"Can't establish a reliable data connection to the server.
This could be a temporary problem or your SIM card may not be provisioned 
for data services. If it continues, call Customer Care."</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<p>I've been racking my brains all day on how to fix this. I have Googled it and read all sorts of articles that suggest a factory reset will help. I really didn't want to do that. I tried using Google talk and trying that – still nothing</p>
<p>I finally read that if i tried to sign into the build in YouTube application on my phone then it would work! I tried it – success!</p>
<p>What a ridiculous bug – in order to add a second Google mail account to my phone I had to sign into YouTube? This is the type of thing that will ruin an OS as its been a bug since early 2010. I'm sure i wouldn't have had this trouble with a WP7</p>
