<p>Today, I got an email to say that my session on “SpecFlow – functional testing made easy” was selected for DDD Scotland. I’m really pleased at this and am very much looking forward to presenting it. I haven’t got a chance to see the full schedule yet but I know of a few other sessions that were selected.</p>  <p>I’m disappointed I won’t get to present my more advanced TeamCity talk there but I will try for another conference for that. Who knows maybe I’ll finally get my workshop up and running for it!</p>  <p>If you are interested in going to this <strong>free</strong> event run for the community, by the community then registration opens on march 14th 2011 at 1230pm (GMT). The registration site is at <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/" target="_blank">developerdeveloperdeveloper.com</a>.</p>  <p>I hope to see you there! :)</p>
