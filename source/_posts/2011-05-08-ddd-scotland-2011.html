<p>Saturday 7th May was <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/">DDD Scotland</a> in Glasgow. I was fortunate enough to be speaking at the event so obviously had to travel up there for the weekend :)</p>
<p>There were a range of good tracks available &ndash; <a href="http://scottishdevelopers.com/2011/03/14/ddd-scotland-2011-agenda/">agenda is here</a> &ndash; and I started the day going to see <a href="http://twitter.com/kendallmiller">Kendall Miller</a> talking about How to Grow Your Own Software Company. Kendall is a very good speaker and delivered a very useful session. I really enjoyed the fact that he was able to relate his talk to his own experiences. If you can get a chance to see this session then I would recommend it &ndash; especially if you are thinking about setting up your own company!</p>
<p>I flitted in and out of a few other sessions throughout the day and really enjoyed the day as a hole. Got some great feedback on my session and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/guysmithferrier">Guy Smith-Ferrier</a> very kindly critiqued my session for me so I can improve my delivery of my session.</p>
<p>Had a great day, met some great people and enjoyed having a day of being a geek. Thanks to the organisers &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ColinMackay">Colin MacKay</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/camurphy">Craig Murphy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ARGibson">Andy Gibson</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/barrycarr">Barry Carr</a>. Thanks again!</p>
