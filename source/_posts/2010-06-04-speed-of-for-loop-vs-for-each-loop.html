title: "Speed of For Loop vs For Each Loop"
comments: true

<p>Tonight i seen, <a href="http://twitter.com/blowdart/status/15337766237" target="_blank">via Twitter</a>, that it was potentially faster to iterate through a collection with a For loop rather than a For Each loop. I didn't believe this [being my usual sceptical self]. Therefore i thought i'd write some sample code to either support the theory and prove it right or to quash it.</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">        static void GetIEnumberableResults()
        {
            //Small Method call in order to get an IEnumerable
            //Then parse this IEnumerable firstly over a For Loop
            //Then over a ForEach Loop - Each Method Returned a TimeSpan
            var strings = GetStrings();
            var forLoopElapsedTimespan = GetForLoopElapsed_ForStrings(strings);
            var forEachLoopElapsedTimeSpan = GetForEachLoopElapsed_ForString(strings);

            Console.WriteLine("Results For IEnumberable");
            CreateResults(forLoopElapsedTimespan, forEachLoopElapsedTimeSpan);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
</pre>

<p>I started with a simple IEnumberable&lt;string&gt; and iterated over this. I expected this to tell me that ForEach was faster than a For loop as this is what i was expecting. The results are below:</p>

<p>I was then told that the size of the collection being iterated over was a char[] of approx 65000.&nbsp;There was a challenge if ever i needed one. I created a char[] of a huge size [6

8000+] ad ran the same iteration over the array.</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">        
        static void GetCharArrayResults()
        {
            //Small Method call in order to get char[] of size 68000 +
            //Then parse this char[] firstly over a For Loop
            //Then over a ForEach Loop - Each Method Returned a TimeSpan
            var chars = GetChars();
            var forLoopElapsed = GetForLoopElapsed_ForCharArray(chars);
            var forEachLoopElapsed = GetForEachLoopElapsed_ForCharArray(chars);

            Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Results for char[] of size {0}", chars.Length));
            CreateResults(forLoopElapsed, forEachLoopElapsed);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
</pre>
<p>Again i expected the ForEach loop to be faster. The results are below:</p>

<p>i have absolutely no idea what's causing this - so if any of you can let me know that would be fantastic. This has really brought out the proper geek in me :)</p>
