<div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday [13th August 2010] was the <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/gulon/" target="_blank">Guathon</a>&nbsp;and i was lucky to get a ticket to it as they usually get all booked out after minutes of opening registration. On the bill was the following topics:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>VS2010 and ASP.NET 4.0</li>
<li>ASP.NET MVC2</li>
<li>Windows Phone 7</li>
<li>Web Futures</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All topics were covered by the &#8216;Gu&#8217; himself apart from Windows phone 7 which was taken by Mike Ormond. I guess session 1 and 2 were revists for me as i have been using VS2010 and .Net 4 since it went RC earlier this year. But there were still a fair few new shortcuts i was able to pick up to help me use visual studio more effectively (maybe i should blog my favourites??)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The session on Windows Phone 7 was something i was very looking forward to but i have to say that having looked at it i feel a bit let down. Mike Ormond presented it very well and done it a lot of justice showing how easy it is to make apps. But this product has been &#8216;sold&#8217; to us all so far as the next generation of phones. But from this session there was something i was able to take away:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The phone will actually put apps into a &#8220;tombstoned&#8221; state when its not running whilst you are doing something else</li>
<li>The phone will not support silverlight in the browser</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first statement about tombstoning made the phone feel basic - you can read more about tombstoning at this post. The iPhone 4 and the Androids can multitaks - they don&#8217;t tombstone apps so why is the latest phone to the market place going to do so? The non support of silverlight in teh browser seems absurd - i understand this is to make sure that people put their apps through the marketplace but what about sites that are silverlight based?? Am i to believe that we cannot browse sites created with silverlight?? I was so surprised with the answer that i had to check it with the person behind me [now found out to be <a href="http://designcoderelease.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Nathan Gloyn]</a>!</p>
<p>Overall impressions of the Win Phone 7 - lovely UI [because of the metro theme] but i think it will take another generation or 2 of it before it even pushes the marketshare of android or apple phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then i got to the session i was looking forward to most - Web Futures. The gu was going to cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>IIS Express</li>
<li>SQL Server CE 4</li>
<li>ASP.NET MVC 3 - with Razor view engine</li>
<li>EF 4 &#8216;Code First&#8217;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All i can say is WOW!. The new technologies for developers [not that webmatrix stuff ;p] looks fantastic. IS Express - a fully functional light version of IIS 7 only difference is that it doesn&#8217;t need an admin account to run it, SQL Server CE 4 is a simple db that we can deploy through the bin and app_data folder and will be able to be looked at via server explorer, EF Code First so simple to start to move towards a domain driven approach for our code without the need for a 3rd party ORM and Razor - what can we say about that! Razor looks unique - it is so simple to use, the syntax is very light and concise and with the replacement of &lt;%: model.&lt;propertyname&gt; %&gt; to @model.propertyname. Its a good area to be moving to - ill certainly be pushing MVC for my newest project.</p>
<p>the gu is such a legend he was even able to show dependency injection and IoC to MVC 3 in 8 minutes ;p!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks to the organisers and speakers: Phil Winstanley, Dave Sussman, Scott Guthrie and Mike Ormond</p>
