  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have recently upgraded my <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/" target="_blank">TeamCity</a> installation 5.1 to 6.0 and found when I was upgrading that the <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/TCD6/Upgrade" target="_blank">documentation</a> supplied by JetBrains was very sketchy. After seeing some peoples upgrades go a bit wrong, I thought a blog post on how to do this would help.</p>  <p><strong><u>This post assumes that you have 5.x version of TeamCity installed. The version I specifically have is 5.1.5</u></strong></p>  <p>1. Download the <a href="http://download.jetbrains.com/teamcity/TeamCity-6.0.exe" target="_blank">latest version</a> of TeamCity windows installer</p>  <p>2. Log into your TeamCity dashboard as an administrator. Click on ‘Administration’</p>  <p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb.png" width="383" height="156" /></a> </p>  <p>3. In the administration screen click on ‘Backup Data’ on the right hand column</p>  <p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_1.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_1.png" width="213" height="268" /></a></p>  <p>4. We now need to actually backup our data. In order to do this we will, by default, be in the ‘Settings’ Tab. In this tab you will see where TeamCity wants to backup the data by default. You will also be given the options of what to backup. The settings I use are as follows:</p>  <p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_2.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_2.png" width="318" height="153" /></a> </p>  <p>Once I save the settings I can then go to ‘Backup Process’ and click on ‘Start Backup’. This gives me something that looks like this</p>  <p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_3.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_3.png" width="446" height="280" /></a> </p>  <p align="left">(Please ignore the numbers as I am running an empty version of TeamCity for this demonstration)</p>  <p align="left">5. Go to the location where point 1 downloaded TeamCity to and run TeamCity.exe</p>  <p align="left">6. Follow the standard installation instructions and make sure you:</p>  <ul>   <li>     <div align="left">install to the same directory location as before (C:\Program Files (x86)\JetBrains\TeamCity for me)</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">uninstall the previous version when asked</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">I tend to only uninstall the build agents log files</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">use the same buildserver directory as before (C:\Program Files (x86)\JetBrains\TeamCity\BuildServer for me)</div>   </li> </ul>  <p align="left">7. Start the TeamCity dashboard after the installer finishes. Gives us this page:</p>  <p align="left"><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_4.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_4.png" width="497" height="185" /></a> </p>  <p align="left">Go to your installation directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\JetBrains\TeamCity\Logs\) then find <strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>teamcity-server.log</strong></p>  <p align="left">8. Open this .log file in notepad or a similar text editor and scroll right to the end and find </p>  <p><strong>Administrator login is required from web UI using authentication token: &lt;token here&gt;</strong></p>  <p>9. Take the token and paste it into the web browser and ‘Confirm’</p>  <p>10. You will be presented with an upgrade screen which gives details of the product and installation paths. If you are happy then click ‘Upgrade’</p>  <p>11. The upgrade will kick into action as follows:</p>  <p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_5.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_5.png" width="244" height="85" /></a></p>  <p>When the upgrade is done you will be shown the login screen. Login as an administrator and make sure you can see all your projects, some history and some changes for some projects</p>  <p>This is a very short process as JetBrains has thankfully made it easy. Hopefully this guide will help</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really like MacOSX and am not a fan that it cannot run natively on my laptop. There my laptop now looks as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_6.png"><img style="display: inline; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_6.png" border="0" alt="image" width="535" height="303" /></a></p>
<p>After seeing this a few people have asked where I got the theme from. Here are the steps to recreate it:</p>
<p>1. Basically I took a MaxOSX Win 7 theme that was already created -&nbsp; <a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/downloads/Mac OS X Snow Leopard for Windows 7.zip" target="_blank">available here</a> - (rehosted by me as first was available after you took surveys etc)</p>
<p>2. After that was installed and working I installed <a href="http://files.punklabs.com/RocketDock/RocketDock-v1.3.5.exe" target="_blank">RocketDock</a></p>
<p>3. Configure RocketDock</p>
<p>4. Enjoy MacOSX theme :)</p>
<p>(PS i have got a full max OSX theme including shell extensions and new icon packs for Windows but its a risky install process &ndash; if you want it then let me know)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read a post from <a href="http://twitter.com/nathangloyn">Nathan Gloyn</a> today on his summary of <a href="http://designcoderelease.blogspot.com/2010/11/scrum-lean-and-kanban-training.html">Scrum, Lean and Kanban training</a> courses here has been on this week. This post made me really think about where I sit on agile methodologies and want to reflect on what works for me.</p>  <h4>Basics of Scrum: </h4>  <p>Iterative process that uses a product backlog to help prioritise work. Work usually happens in short sprints (2 –4 weeks), has a load of roles and has 3 artefacts (product backlog, sprint backlog and burndown chart). Scrum has a lot of rules to follow! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)">(more on scrum)</a></p>  <h4>Basics of Kanban:</h4>  <p>Process that doesn’t use times iterations, once something is removed from the task board, it is replaced by the next highest priority item. It doesn’t have many rules except, its focus on reducing work in progress, strict prioritization and limiting demand after capacity. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)">(more on kanban)</a></p>  <h4>What does scrum not work for me?</h4>  <p>Well as scrum is timed iterations and NOT have a work in progress then for me too much got started and not enough was actually finished.</p>  <p>In the team I worked in Scrum with, we had 4 developers working on a 2 week iteration that has so many little tasks. This meant that lots of little tasks were in a “doing” state and any external influences that delayed the project meant that at the end of the sprint then we hadn’t finished everything and then the sprint had to be extended</p>  <p><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="http://www.bti360.com/uploads/ScrumBoard_Test.jpg" /></p>  <p>I found this image from bti360.com that illustrates the point. suppose we are in a 3 week sprint and we got to this stage after 2 weeks. If the QA was off sick and couldn’t test for a week (i know this is against Scrum but it can happen) then there is a risk that nothing in this sprint would be finished at the end of the sprint</p>  <p>So with Kanban if the same thing were to happen then we would have to have a limit on the columns. Then we would actually finish tasks BEFORE other tasks were started and thus we could identify a bottle neck a lot earlier as there would be a halt to the board due to a WIP violation</p>  <p>I found this image on agilejournal.com to illustrate what a typical Kanban board looks like.</p>  <p><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/2009/images/kanban_board.jpg" width="569" height="350" /></p>  <p>As you can see there are lots of tasks in “Done” and tasks are spread across the board rather than all piled in 1 column. </p>  <p>This seems to work well with the environment I&#8217;m currently involved with. We work in a reactive development environment that can change daily so therefore planning sprints would not be conducive whereas taking a task by task system helps us a lot.</p>  <h3>Summary</h3>  <p>Kanban works for me because:</p>  <ul>   <li>the business decides what is the most important priority on a day to day basis as it can change </li>    <li>our teams can work on multiple projects and need to be moving in and out of projects fast </li>    <li>timed iterations may not actually reflect release points </li>    <li>expedites can be added to the current work in progress without affecting the work currently in progress and without changing the dynamics of a sprint </li> </ul>  <p>These are just my thoughts considering I don&#8217;t work in an environment where Scrum can benefit us. I haven’t been in an environment where we can spend time planning a few weeks work – work has always been reactive for me.</p>  <p>Just my $0.02 <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/wlEmoticon-smile_1.png" /></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am currently sitting in the hotel reception ready to leave for the airport after a cracking weekend in Dundee for the 1st NoSql developers conference.</p>
<p>I am quite new the the NoSql space and really though it would be way over my head. But the speakers helped me to really understand what the movement is and what its about. The conference had a few different NoSql databases for speaking about. They included <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/" target="_blank">Cassandra</a>, <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/" target="_blank">Hadoop</a> with <a href="http://hbase.apache.org/" target="_blank">HBase</a>, <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/" target="_blank">CouchDB</a>, <a href="http://ravendb.net/" target="_blank">RavenDb</a> and <a href="http://voltdb.com/" target="_blank">VoltDb</a>.</p>
<p>First up, before any of the actual implementations on NoSql, was <a href="http://twitter.com/garyshort" target="_blank">Gary Short</a> of DevExpress to speak on &ldquo;Is NoSql the future of data storage?&rdquo;. This was a very interesting talk for me. It taught me a lot about what NoSql databases actually are, all the different types of NoSql databases are, real word examples of where NoSql implementations are in place. Twitters example of a NoSql database, FlockDb was broken down to show what it has to deal with and what it effective does. I&#8217;m going to have to make a blog post on the back of this session alone.</p>
<p>Next up was Dundee university&rsquo;s own <a href="http://twitter.com/andycobley" target="_blank">Andy Cobley</a> to speak on Cassandra. This session was an introduction to Cassandra and where it sits on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem" target="_blank">CAP theorem</a>. The session them became a bit advanced for a NoSql n00b such as myself as it went into replication, topology and consistency levels of NoSql. I know facebook used to use Cassandra so it must be very good at what it does, but I wasn&rsquo;t overly keen on it, mostly due to the fact of how to interface to Cassandra. I&rsquo;m sure the interfacing will continue to evolve, but as Facebook no longer use the technology, I question its longevity??</p>
<p>There was a proposed session on Windows Azure by <a href="http://twitter.com/drmarcustillett" target="_blank">Marcus Tillet</a>, sadly Marcus wasn&rsquo;t able to make it due to problems at Birmingham airport. All the other slots were moved forward so Jonathan Forbes took the stage with Hadoop and HBase. Now it really pains me to say it, but this was more of a sales pitch for the product rather than showing an actual example of implementation. There was a very very short demo but by that stage I really felt disjointed from the speaker. Maybe if i re-read Jonathan&rsquo;s slides then I may be a bit more connected to the product.</p>
<p>CouchDb was next presented by Simon Wells of University of Dundee. Now Simon admitted he hadn&rsquo;t actually been using CouchDb at an enterprise level but from his demonstration and knowledge of the product I wouldn&rsquo;t have known that. He deserved a big amount of credit for that. Ok so the presentation talked about what CouchDb is and the history of its existence. An example of how to use the product from both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL" target="_blank">Curl</a> and <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Getting_started_with_Futon" target="_blank">Futon</a>. Finally I was getting a demo of a product that I could see myself using.</p>
<p>RavenDb was then presented by <a href="http://twitter.com/robashton" target="_blank">Rob Ashton</a>. This was a product I had seen before and I was impressed with it then. Since that last time, Rob had changed the presenting of the product and it was absolutely fantastic. I really connected with the product. This was a presentation with a lot of actual coding and better yet, since Raven is built on C#, I actually followed it a lot more than I did with that of Cassandra demo. In my eyes, this product is a real winner and it will really help me in things I plan to do.</p>
<p>Last spot was Mark Whitehorn speaking on VoltDb. Not it seemed to me that there was not really a lot of speaking about Voltdb. That I really didnt mind about because Mark really tied the entire show together with his presentation. He really made me understand what the NoSql movement is doing and help understand the problems of RBDMS that it tries to overcome. He was a fantastic speaker and the entire room was engrossed. Even the event twitter feed went silent for his talk (and that was going mad all day with some real good banter).</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the weekend as it gave me a chance to meet some people who I have been speaking to on twitter for quite a while and it was great to put a face to a name. I am looking forward to seeing them all at <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/ddd9/" target="_blank">DDD9</a>.</p>
<p>My huge thanks go to Andy Cobley and all those involved in organising the event. There is a real interest in this subject from the community it seems and I&rsquo;m sure a bigger version towards London would be much busier.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I was introduced to a new concept for me called Firebreak, by <a href="http://twitter.com/nathangloyn">Nathan Gloyn</a>. Before you read on, if you are not familiar with it then please take a few minutes to read his post – <a href="http://pstack.tk/1">Firebreak</a></p>  <p>I am so impressed that this is actually a concept that is used but I can see how this can feel a bit off to development managers.</p>  <p><strong>Firstly, will a development manager of a small team really want to stop new feature productivity of everyone for a week?</strong> I know other things will be done in that week off but I find this will be a hard sell</p>  <p>My workaround for this is to let parts of the team go on firebreak rather than the entire team. This would mean at least something&#8217;s can still be delivered to the customer. </p>  <p><strong>Secondly, how will a developer prove to their manager that they have actually spent the time constructive?</strong></p>  <p>Well as Nathan suggested “grok” talks or share sessions are a great idea for this. These are small sessions designed to become familiar with the “learning&#8217;s” of the topic.</p>  <p>This would be one of the perks that I’d join a company for as I think it seems such a fantastic idea! This is something I will certainly try and introduce to my team if I can as I feel a lot of teh guys would benefit hugely</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This book was a real introduction to Silverlight for me as I have never had ‘real’ exposure to it. Therefore I was delighted when I was given the opportunity to review it. For me, the book was an introduction into how Silverlight, or RIAs, can be used in to develop real world applications and not just Twitter clients like I have seen in demos.</p>  <p>The book was well structured as it gave an introduction to what Silverlight is, then&#160; discussed the controls, then how to use data in applications. The book even talked about Blend and game development. It is exactly what I was looking for in a book to help me understand the wider sense of the Silverlight world that I kept hearing about.</p>  <p><em><u>Chapter 1: Hello, Silverlight</u></em></p>  <p>This is an introduction RIA (Rich Internet Applications) and how RIAs can be different to develop for compared to the web. Silverlight is obviously the RIA that will be being discussed in this book. The author discusses how developers who work on the .net framework can create Silverlight applications using the tools they already know.</p>  <p>The author discusses the fact that, with Silverlight, designers and developers can work together more effectively because of the tools involved.</p>  <p>the last part of the chapter discusses the anatomy of a Silverlight application including reference to the .xap and how these applications can be deployed.</p>  <p><em><u>Chapter 2: Silverlight Controls</u></em></p>  <p>The basic controls of Silverlight seem similar to that of web development i.e. button, grid, textbox, label etc. The author discusses the basic use of these controls plus some further ones that are used in Silverlight, stack panel, layout panels and the Rich text area (in SL4). The chapter doesn&#8217;t go into huge depth about the controls but describes their basic anatomy and use.</p>  <p><em><u>Chapter 3: Data Services in Silverlight 4</u></em></p>  <p>Databinding in Silverlight applications falls into 3 different categories (one time, one way and two way). The chapter discusses how you can use the XAML to bind data to objects without the need for code behind files to be used. </p>  <p>The chapter then goes on to talk about Isolated storage and how important this can be for a developer. I can see how Isolated storage can be abused easily but I can also see its power in developing applications.</p>  <p><em><u>Chapter 4: Learning Xaml Through Blend</u></em></p>  <p>Blend is a tool by Microsoft that can help create XAML from building a nice UI. This chapter discussed how Blend can be used by designers to work on the SAME files as the developer is working on. </p>  <p><em><u>Chapter 5: Creating a Fish Eye Menu</u></em></p>  <p>The chapter touched briefly on the patterns of building a site e.g. MVVM and how pages and user controls can be combined to create a multipage application. the chapter also talked about storyboards and control templates to help create a more interactive application. </p>  <p>There was lots to digest in this chapter but the fact that the user gives step by step instructions on how this can be done means that the user can really learn how this happens. This was a very useful chapter in getting our hands ‘dirty’ with the code.</p>  <p><em><u>Chapter 6: WCF RIA Services to the Rescue</u></em></p>  <p>Silverlight toolkit and RIA services are external libraries that can be used to create a “better” applications. This is another chapter that actually lets the user get their hands dirty with code and how to consume a RIA service. Interactions with file system, validation and customizing user feedback was all discussed and all very important areas of building an application</p>  <p>This was a critical chapter for me as I really started to embrace the power of Silverlight. Previously, I was of the opinion it was not really used for ‘business-like’ applications, but this chapter made me see otherwise</p>  <p><em><u>Chapter 7: Out of Browser Mode</u></em></p>  <p>Out of browser is as it sounds, the application doesn’t need to run in the browser. There are pros and cons to this. Firstly, the pro is that the application can run on mac (unlike WPF). The cons are the system must still have Silverlight installed. </p>  <p>Installations of OOB applications can be customized to provide valuable user feedback to keep the user informed of what is actually happing to their system. The use of trusted mode means that the OOB app can make use of COM objects and much more on the host computer. </p>  <p>Silverlight traditionally runs&#160; in a ‘sandbox’ type environment where it has very little access to the host machine, OOB can remove this ‘sandbox’ like environment where it can actually work with the host machine in order to use system resources.&#160; WPF has more access but again we must point out Silverlight OOBs can run on mac <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/wlEmoticon-smile.png" /></p>  <p><em><u>Chapter 8: Game development in Silverlight</u></em></p>  <p>This chapter was a lot different to what was discussed so far. Up until now the book talked about using Silverlight to create applications, both in and out of browser. But not the author discusses how Silverlight can be used to actually create games. The beauty of using Silverlight for game development, is that it uses vector graphics which can scale whereas bitmap images cannot. </p>  <p>Sprites, loops and collisions are all terms and techniques talked about to create an interactive games for users. This is a tough chapter for me as I am not really into game development. I can see how Silverlight can be good fro game development but its not for me…. yet!</p>  <p>Great book, really enjoyed it! Since reading this book I have bought a Silverlight 4 book as I really want to start furthering my Silverlight skills <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/wlEmoticon-smile.png" /></p>  <p>Thanks to Manning books and the authors, Bill Reiss and Dave Campbell, for an excellent introduction to this huge topic. </p>  <p>Id recommend this book for Silverlight n00bs as it will give you that taster to wet your appetite.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To continue in my evangelism of Simple.Data, I have decided to write a series of posts about how to use the product. The first part is how to get started with Simple.Data. This post will simple describe how we actually incorporate Simple.Data in an application.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the source from Github - <a href="http://github.com/markrendle/Simple.Data">http://github.com/markrendle/Simple.Data</a> </li>
<li>Open the .sln file and build it </li>
<li>When the project is built then the required libraries are in the following location: &lt;solutiondirectory&gt;\Simple.Data\bin\&lt;configuration&gt;\ </li>
<li>The required files are Simple.Data.dll, Simple.Data.pdb </li>
<li>Add the files above to your lib or assemblies directory </li>
<li>Reference Simple.Data.dll from your application </li>
<li>Add the following to your web.config </li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;?xml version=&#8221;1.0&#8221; encoding=&#8221;utf-8&#8221; ?&gt;    <br />&lt;configuration&gt;     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;configSections&gt;     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/configSections&gt;     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;connectionStrings&gt;     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;add name=&#8221;Simple.Data.Properties.Settings.ConnectionString&#8221;     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connectionString=&#8221;server&rdquo;;initial catalog=&rdquo;databasename&rdquo;;integrated security=true&#8221; /&gt;     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;     <br />&lt;/configuration&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! We are now ready to actually start querying your database.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week my tool of the week is Console. This is an application that allows the hosting of different shell types all under 1 application.</p>  <p>I can have different tabs open in the application and each tab can relate to a different shell type as follows:</p>  <p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/tabs.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="tabs" border="0" alt="tabs" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/tabs_thumb.png" width="244" height="71" /></a> </p>  <p>This is very useful for me as I use Ruby command prompt a lot and use pinned icons to my Win 7 taskbar.</p>  <p>Its simple to add new shell types. Edit &gt; Settings </p>  <p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/settings.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="settings" border="0" alt="settings" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/settings_thumb.png" width="244" height="162" /></a> </p>  <p>then add a new tab and complete the details. The last part of the application that I really like is the improved copy and paste functionality. There is a right click context menu that has the following options:</p>  <p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/rightclick.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="rightclick" border="0" alt="rightclick" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/rightclick_thumb.png" width="244" height="182" /></a> </p>  <p>In my opinion its a fantastic product and its OSS. Check it out from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/" target="_blank">sourceforge</a>. This is a definite 5/5 and has made my development environment a lot more company.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while back I seen some tweets from <a href="http://twitter.com/markrendle" target="_blank">Mark Rendle</a> on his version of Microsoft.Data, Simple.Data, as it seemed to be causing distress for developers when it was announced earlier.</p>
<p>I offered to give Simple.Data a trial for Mark as I was doing a small personal project at the time that was far too simple to use a well known ORM or a horrible amount of ADO.NET code. So after getting the sample solution from Mark and reading through the integration and unit tests, my eyes were opened up to a new wave of ORM.</p>
<p>Lets talk about the requirements of adding this ORM to our solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>.Net 4 framework </li>
<li>Connectionstring called Simple.Data </li>
<li>References to                  
<ul>
<li>Simple.Data.dll </li>
<li>Simple.DataSetExtensions.dll </li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>Yes that&#8217;s it! Its that easy. I was suitably impressed straight away as I have played with a&nbsp; few ORMs that require some configuration and mappings files to be created. This was very early on for Simple.Data, so there was not much documentation. In-fact the tests <strong>were</strong> the documentation :)</p>
<p>So I was using this to kill the need to use ADO.NET and we all know how much code we would have had to write to get that working. In fact, I&#8217;m sure I would have used Enterprise Library or something to get it going and make things easier. (Lets assume I would have used Ent. Lib for code examples.)</p>
<p>First off was to write some code to select data from a users table. With ADO.NET the code would have looked as follows:</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">public User GetUserById(int userId)
{
    var returnedUser = new User();
    try
    {
        var command = db.GetStoredProcCommand("storedprocname", userId);
	    var reader = db.ExecuteReader(command);
	    while (reader.Read())
	    {
	        returnedUser = User.GetUserDetails(reader);
	    }
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        DataAccessExceptionHandler.HandleSqlException(ex);
    }
    
    return returnedUser;
}</pre>
<p>How does this look with Simple.Data? Well as simple as this:</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">public User GetUserByUserId(int userId)
{
    dynamic db = Database.Open();
    var dbUser = db.Users.FindByUserId(userId);

    if (dbUser != null)
    {
        return dbUser;
    }
    else
        return new User();
}
</pre>
<p>This makes it a LOT simpler and no need for a stored procedure. Basically it uses the dynamic keyword of C# in order to get the properties of the User table for a specified user and then puts the column names and their values in the dynamic object.</p>
<p>The same shortening and less complex methods are in place for getting lists of users and items from the database as well as inserting (using Named parameters) and also deleting rows by a specified column name. This was a basic introduction about how easy I found Simple.Data to use.
