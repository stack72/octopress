<p>A while back I wrote a post on what passion means to me. Someone asked me to discuss how I achieved a work / life balance so I thought I&rsquo;d write this post while on holiday (ironic eh!)</p>
<p>So, as someone who believes they have passion, I guess i can be described as working a lot. This doesn&rsquo;t just mean my day job but it means studying/reading new things, writing code of my own for research applications or helping others with development related tasks. I read a lot of development books as well so I&rsquo;m sure this can really eat into my time.</p>
<p>I personally think that definitions of disconnecting and developer burnout&nbsp; are subjective. But even more, each developer has their own way or preventing burnout and from disconnecting from their life as a developer. I am absolutely addicted to twitter and I am on there an awful lot. I don&rsquo;t feel that when I&rsquo;m on twitter that I&rsquo;m working or engaging in work. Certainly it can make me talk about work but I don&rsquo;t generally have Visual Studio open while I&rsquo;m on there. This, to me, means that twitter isn&rsquo;t really stopping me from disconnecting. I use it more as a social networking tool &ndash; to talk to other developers who can help me, to bookmark articles for use later when I am on my laptop.</p>
<p>So what is disconnecting to me? I feel that it&rsquo;s when I don&rsquo;t writing code, don&rsquo;t do overtime at work, don&rsquo;t look at emails and generally don&rsquo;t do any development related tasks. I can still tweet &ndash; twitter is facebook for geeks so tweeting is just being social! Disconnecting goes hand in hand with trying to prevent myself burning out. Burning out is doing far too much &ndash; this can stem from working too many hours or working strange or anti-social hours. This can cause slight depression in some cases or problems at home. First stage of burnout to me is when I cannot sleep because all I can think about is my work or my projects.</p>
<p>Burnout I&rsquo;m told can be a bit of a killer to a developer. Burnout can occur when a developer works too much. This can be overtime for day job or can be working late hours on a personal project. I don&rsquo;t feel I have been &ldquo;burnt out&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m honestly not in a position to say this. I&rsquo;m sure my girlfriend would be a better judge of this. In order to try and stay away from burnout I tend to try and have 3 nights a week away from work related activities. During this time I still tweet (but hey its on my phone so its ok ;)) but I don&rsquo;t actively do any development related activities unless they are classed as incredibly urgent. My girlfriend and my dog are the things that keep me focused way from work when I&rsquo;m on a &ldquo;night off&rdquo;. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll continue to not be 100% workaholic but as my job changes or new things happen or are released in the development work things may change. Lets just hope that I can be strong and not give up all my free time!</p>
