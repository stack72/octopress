title: "Finally, a Visual Studio Extension Sync Tool"

<p>A while back I made a post about an itme I wanted for Visual Studio 2010. The item I wanted was a tool to sync my installed extensions' between any machines that I used Visual Studio on. This wasn’t available, or so I though, but thanks to Latish Sehgal such a tool now exists. </p>  <p>The post on the tool can be found on his <a href="http://dotnetsurfers.com/blog/2011/03/14/extensionsync-a-visual-studio-extension-to-synchronize-other-extensions/" target="_blank">blog</a>. I think this is a tool that can be utilised from within teams and also for users who use multiple machines and installs of Visual Studio.</p>  <p>I’d like to thank Latish a lot for the tool! It has made the way I use Visual Studio much more uniform and that can only be a good thing!</p>
