<p>A heads up really but I used the Dynamic keyword this weekend past in .Net 4. I noticed that after doing it a new reference was added to my solution &ndash; Microsoft.csharp.dll</p>
<p>I didn't know what this was so referred to good old Stackoverflow and here's what it is</p>

<p>just quite interesting &ndash; not sure if this will be in the RTM version of VS2010 though</p>
