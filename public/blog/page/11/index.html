  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the first things i had to do when i got to my new company was to build an application that would allow the remote restart of a web application. After much searching to find the correct thing i found the use of DirectoryEntry</p>
<p>In order to use it i had to import the name space:</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">using System.DirectoryServices;
</pre>
<p>This meant that i was able to access the correct part of AD in order to call the correct method that could tell me what the correct status of the app was and also to change the status to another state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first method i used was InvokeGet - this took an application pool path and then returned an int that was the state of that application pool. the app pool path was made up as follows:</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">var appPoolPath = String.Format(@"IIS://{0}/W3SVC/AppPools/{1}", 
                                 Environment.MachineName, 
                                 ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["applicationPoolName"]);
</pre>
<p>using this path we could then call a method as follows:</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">DirectoryEntry w3svc = new DirectoryEntry(appPoolPath);
var currentStatus = (int)w3svc.InvokeGet("AppPoolState");
</pre>
<p>the int returned could then be deciphered to get the current status. If the int was 2 then the app pool is &#8220;running&#8221;, if the int was &#8220;4&#8221; then the app pool was stopped. i only checked for those 2 states and made the default be state &#8220;unknown&#8221;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this meant that as we have the current state then we could then decide was was available to do and what not to do. By using a different method and passing in the command name and app pool name could we then change is state.</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">var appPoolPath = String.Format(@"IIS://{0}/W3SVC/AppPools/{1}", 
                                 Environment.MachineName, 
                                 ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["applicationPoolName"]);
var command = "start";
DirectoryEntry w3svc = new DirectoryEntry(appPoolPath);
w3svc.Invoke(command, null);
</pre>
<p>We are passing in null as there are no parameters that i needed to go with this. But it can accept a [] of args if needed. We can call stop in exactly the same way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So whats the point of this post ihear you ask?? Well there are certain conditions that you can run this application under. The main one is that the user that the application pool needs to run under needs to be a local machine administration in order to interact with AD. this of course will not be a good thing to do on a live webserver - so what are the alternatives?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nada, nothing, zilch! This is needed and the only way you can stop attacks on the server is possibly to run this under basic IIS authentication within an IP range and a known user with a ridiculously difficult password. I only discovered all of this after i had actually written the little application and this idea has since been trashed!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So back to remoting into the webserver for IIS application pool crashes! c&#8217;est la vie!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So its been a while and since my last post i have moved on from my previous job. I was sad to go as i was there for 4 years but i needed to move on to further my career.</p>
<p>Since moving to my new place of work i have had to initially do the follow:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>restructure SVN</li>
<li>setup CI server [TeamCity]</li>
<li>move all unit tests to NUnit 2.5.5</li>
<li>automate builds</li>
<li>break code dependencies</li>
</ul>
<div>This has been a very good move for me as it has really let me get my teeth into my new work. I expect this new role to be a challenge that will set me in good standing for the further.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The only drawback of the new job is the fact i need to take the train everyday - ALL CHANGE PLEASE!!!</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Saturday 5th June, <a href="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/" target="_blank">DDD South West</a> was held at UWE Bristol. There are not many opportunities for a DDD event so it is always very busy. There were 6 tracks and 5 sessions in each track. A wide and diverse range of talks were given by dedicated speakers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started the day going to a session on the Task Parallel Library by <a href="http://blogs.imeta.co.uk/sstrong/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Steve Strong</a>. I had been looking into the TPL recently and thought this may be a good idea to go to to help me learn about it. There was an amazing amount of content that Steve tried to cover. I learned an awful lot and since then have implemented come concurrency in some of my applications. I recommend anyone to see Steve talk on this as he really does know his stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to attend the Alternative track for my next session. This track was a balloon debate on ORM vs SQL vs Entity Framework 4 vs NoSQL. Basically the speakers had to argue their corner in order not to be voted off the &ldquo;balloon&rdquo; by the attendees. First up, <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/iupdateable/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Eric Nelson</a> from Microsoft to speak on Entity Framework 4. <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/twickers/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Liam Westley</a> on traditional SQL. <a href="http://blog.stevensanderson.com/" target="_blank">Steve Sanderson</a> gave a well researched piece on NoSQL then finally <a href="http://garyshortblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Gary Short</a> gave a very good overview of the use of ORM &ndash; it actually enlightened me to how wide a range of things that ORM&rsquo;s can be used for</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It then came to a session i was looking forward to, Crap Code and the Disasters it Causes by <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/plip/" target="_blank">Phil Winstanley</a>. I am very passionate about this subject so i was hoping that it would help me to improve the way i work. I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed &ndash; Phil pointed out some truly awful code and sorted the code samples into the types of developers who made the errors. The one thing i took away from this session &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t know you could put a GOTO inside a SWITCH statement [WTF???]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grok talks were given over lunchtime &ndash; the ones of interest to me Cyclomatic Complexity and DotLess Css &ndash; i think ill make some future blog posts about these. Sorry to Silverlight 4 and BlogEngine.net but next time maybe :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Code Contracts with Barry Carr was the next session. This was a truly heavy session to get my head around. I understood the concept of it &ndash; to make sure that the code does what it says it does and that the client will do what they says they will. But i couldn&rsquo;t understand why you would do this as in massively overinflated the code base. I&#8217;m sure there are ways to do this and i will definitely be looking into this in the future as its a real extension of testing inputs and outputs [as well as lots of other stuff]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last session of the day was CQRS with <a href="http://neildoesdotnet.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Neil Robbins</a>. Bad start to the session of Neil as his laptop gave way and he had to borrow one to give the presentation. He gave an excellent talk on CQRS. It really made me see that the work im doing currently is very basic in comparison to this type of architecture. I didn&rsquo;t understand this thoroughly but i think another talk or 2 on this [hopefully <a href="http://skillsmatter.com" target="_blank">skillsmatter</a> will come through for me on this :)] and i reckon i&rsquo;d be very much taken by this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall a great day. I met a lot of people and there are others i really wished i had a chance to see or meet. Next time though. I shall definitely be at the next DDD event &ndash; talks are currently for Ireland on 25th Sept :) &ndash; and id recommend this to anyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fingers crossed i get a chance to make some further posts on this :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight i seen, <a href="http://twitter.com/blowdart/status/15337766237" target="_blank">via Twitter</a>, that it was potentially faster to iterate through a collection with a For loop rather than a For Each loop. I didn&#8217;t believe this [being my usual sceptical self]. Therefore i thought i&#8217;d write some sample code to either support the theory and prove it right or to quash it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">        static void GetIEnumberableResults()
        {
            //Small Method call in order to get an IEnumerable
            //Then parse this IEnumerable firstly over a For Loop
            //Then over a ForEach Loop - Each Method Returned a TimeSpan
            var strings = GetStrings();
            var forLoopElapsedTimespan = GetForLoopElapsed_ForStrings(strings);
            var forEachLoopElapsedTimeSpan = GetForEachLoopElapsed_ForString(strings);

            Console.WriteLine("Results For IEnumberable");
            CreateResults(forLoopElapsedTimespan, forEachLoopElapsedTimeSpan);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started with a simple IEnumberable&lt;string&gt; and iterated over this. I expected this to tell me that ForEach was faster than a For loop as this is what i was expecting. The results are below:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/2010/6/Capture-IEnumerable.GIF" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was then told that the size of the collection being iterated over was a char[] of approx 65000.&nbsp;There was a challenge if ever i needed one. I created a char[] of a huge size [6
<script src="http://www.paulstack.co.uk/blog/editors/tiny_mce3/themes/advanced/langs/en.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
8000+] ad ran the same iteration over the array.</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">        
        static void GetCharArrayResults()
        {
            //Small Method call in order to get char[] of size 68000 +
            //Then parse this char[] firstly over a For Loop
            //Then over a ForEach Loop - Each Method Returned a TimeSpan
            var chars = GetChars();
            var forLoopElapsed = GetForLoopElapsed_ForCharArray(chars);
            var forEachLoopElapsed = GetForEachLoopElapsed_ForCharArray(chars);

            Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Results for char[] of size {0}", chars.Length));
            CreateResults(forLoopElapsed, forEachLoopElapsed);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
</pre>
<p>Again i expected the ForEach loop to be faster. The results are below:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/2010/6/Capture-char.GIF" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have absolutely no idea what&#8217;s causing this - so if any of you can let me know that would be fantastic. This has really brought out the proper geek in me :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Very simple tip i found at <a href="http://www.devevening.co.uk" target="_blank">DevEvening</a> tonight from <a href="http://blog.markrendle.net/" target="_blank">Mark Rendle</a></p>
<p>To create a new IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; and add items to that IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; then something very small along the lines of:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">        private static IEnumerable GetStrings()
        {
            yield return "a";
            yield return "b";
            yield return "c";
            yield return "d";
            yield return "e";
            yield return "f";
            yield return "g";
            yield return "h";
            yield return "i";
            yield return "j";
            yield return "k";
            yield return "l";
            yield return "m";
            yield return "n";
        }
</pre>
<p>I&#8217;m sure most of you knew this but it was never something i knew how to do. i usually ended up doing something along the lines of</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">        private static IEnumerable ConvertListToIEnumberable()
        {
            var&gt; listStrings = new List();
            listStrings.Add("a");
            listStrings.Add("b");
            listStrings.Add("c");
            listStrings.Add("d");
            listStrings.Add("e");

            IEnumerable ienumString = listStrings;
            return ienumString;
        }
</pre>
<p>Possibly useful to you, possibly not as you may already know it :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There seems to be a misunderstanding between continuous integration (CI) and build automation. I was confused with this until recently when i looked deeper into the concept.</p>
<p><strong>Build Automation:</strong> The process of automating a build process, on a nightly bases for example, as well as doing it manually when writing an application.</p>
<p>There tools that i use commonly for this are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>NAnt </li>
<li>MSBuild </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Integration:</strong> This is the process of using &ldquo;triggers&rdquo; to listen to various events in order to perform some tasks. e.g. a developer checks into SVN CAUSING A TRIGGER to fire that will run a build of the solution and also will run the unit tests or automated acceptance tests.</p>
<p>The confusion seems to occur when CI tools are used for build automation but are not configured to use triggers to perform events</p>
<p>CI Tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/" target="_blank">TeamCity </a></li>
<li><a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">CruiseControl.NET </a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TeamCity is not one i have used but it seems to be easier to configure tasks than CCNET as CCNET requires everything to be configured via huge XML files .</p>
<p>This is apparent in my current employment setup :    <br />On a nightly basis we schedule CCNET to automate builds via NAnt scripts. These are performed via NAnt scheduling and<strong> NOT </strong>via triggers. These CCNET scripts are pretty awful as they require configuration without a UI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has lead me to understand now that i currently perform build automation and <strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp; continuous integration. I guess the next step for me now is to start to use TeamCity in order to understand CI better and potentially use it on a small project at work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Received some great feedback/ advice for this:</p>
<p>&#8220;There is confusion, I would advise people to get to grips with nant first and when they have the build script working then try cc.net after. Trying to do both together before you understand the theory and technology can be very confusing and strange.&#8221;<br /><a href="http://www.paulthor.co.uk/" target="_blank"> Paul Thorrington</a></p>

<div>When a function/ method replies of global variables then it cannot be determined that that variable has not been changed before the function uses it. Of course you could write a check in the function for the correct type but this seems to be a tight coupling towards that type. Therefore the calling function may fail/ throw an exception&nbsp;</div>

<div><br /></div>
<div>So in order to keep our functions side effect free then we should pass in the variable that the function uses rather than rely on it globally.</div>

<div>This is because a function is a piece of code that should take parameters, process them and return a result. The parameters or the result can even be functions if necessary. This all accounts for a very <strong>pure</strong>&nbsp;function</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>When at Oliver&#8217;s talk i asked the question:</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;How does functional programming help with unit testing and TDD?&#8221;</em></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Oliver pointed out that this is perfect for unit testing as it has no outside influences, therefore if written correctly, it can be tested easily. This function is what we try to product when we write code via TDD - that pure function - as unit tests shouldn&#8217;t have any dependencies.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How Does a Reduction in Side-Effects Help Us?</span></strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<ul>
<li>Scalability</li>
<li>Optimized</li>
<li>Tested</li>
<li>Easily Debugged</li>
</ul>
<div>our code is modularized and potenailly <strong>clean</strong>&nbsp;and well refactored as the function should be pure.</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Oliver showed coding examples of how you go from a function that has side effects and how this can be refactored or cleaned in order to make that function pure. As time constraints got the better of us there was not a huge amount of time to go into details of F# - we had an overview of what F# was and we seen the code samples in F#. From what I seen of it, it looks like id have to delve into that further to grasp anything firm. A small amount of time was given to Parallel in DotNet 4 - since the demo i have looked into this myself and see its very nice - blog post to follow</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This was yet another talk that really helped me to think about my current practices. I would definately recommend seeing this talk if you get the opportunity as Oliver is an excellent presenter. He has very kindly put his slides on <a href="http://www.sturmnet.org/blog/2010/04/14/slides-and-samples-from-my-edgeug-techda" target="_blank">his blog</a>. Thanks to Oliver for Code samples i have used here.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Thanks to Oliver and Gavin from Edge UG for a very worthwhile talk</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>iPhone OS 4 released today - lots of lovely features that would really entice me to get one after my blackberry storm. Then i was pointed out an extract from the SDK licence agreement</h2>
<p><img src="/blog/images/2010/4/onlyc.GIF" alt="" /></p>
<p>ok so what does this mean? c# developers can currently use an application called <a href="http://monotouch.net/" target="_blank">Monotouch</a> and this was fantastic. it was pricey but it was very worth it. i had even started using this myself for apps at work</p>
<p>then this bombshell!! There was no news of this announcement today - this was discovered by people downloading the SDK</p>
<p>ok so i think that what has happened is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone versions 1 -3 very successful</li>
<li>Microsoft release news of Win 7 Phone</li>
<li>News of free developer software for Win 7 Phone released</li>
<li>Apple release news of iPhone 4.0</li>
</ul>
<h3>Now what does this tells us?</h3>
<p>in my eyes this seems like Apple have laid down the law that their apps will only really be developed using their products and their specs. No more MonoTouch? What about those who were creating apps using c#?</p>
<p>I think more will come of this and i really do think that this will loose Apple a huge amount of followers in the development community.</p>
<p>Let the war begin!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/2010/4/battle.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>More details and posts will be added as soon as i see them!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A heads up really but I used the Dynamic keyword this weekend past in .Net 4. I noticed that after doing it a new reference was added to my solution &ndash; Microsoft.csharp.dll</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what this was so referred to good old Stackoverflow and here&#8217;s what it is</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2460883/what-is-microsoft-csharp-dll-in-net-4-0">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2460883/what-is-microsoft-csharp-dll-in-net-4-0</a></p>
<p>just quite interesting &ndash; not sure if this will be in the RTM version of VS2010 though</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I currently use Enterprise Logging 3.1 and i know it can be configured to do what i want with it but it still has horrible log files that no-one likes to review.&nbsp;Over the past few months i have been looking at Exceptioneer - <a href="http://exceptioneer.com/Public/Demonstration.aspx" target="_blank">use this link to find out more</a>. I would continue to use exceptioneer in tandem with enterprise logging as it is a 3rd party service [and my boss would never let me move solely to exceptioneer :)].&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed the steps to integrate exceptioneer from their site - addition of the .dll file and addition of the sections inside web.config. But this didnt work with Enterprise logging as the exceptions were not unhandled - i have customer code in order to handle the exceptions</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">protected void Application_Error(Object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	UIExceptionHandler.HandleException(Server.GetLastError(), true);
}
</pre>
<p>Pretty simple i know! so i took advantage of this method were all my UI exceptions were being routed to - therefore i was able to call the Exceptioneer client straight from here. i added a reference to Exceptioneer.WebClient.dll and added in a little custom code [i have changed my APIKey and application name to a config property so they can be managed without a redeployment]</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">protected void Application_Error(Object sender, EventArgs e)
{
         var wc = new Client
                            {
                              ApiKey = Config.Settings.ExceptioneerApiKey,
                              ApplicationName = Config.Settings.ExceptioneerApplicationName,
                              CurrentException = Server.GetLastError()
                            };
          wc.Submit(); 
         UIExceptionHandler.HandleException(Server.GetLastError(), true);
}
</pre>
<p>Then worried about what would happen if i couldnt connect to Exceptioneer, so i added a try catch to it and also i didnt want to log local exceptions to exceptioneer. Therefore my final method was as follows:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">protected void Application_Error(Object sender, EventArgs e)
{
            try
            {
                if (Config.Settings.EnableExceptioneerLogging)
                {
                    var wc = new Client
                                 {
                                     ApiKey = Config.Settings.ExceptioneerApiKey,
                                     ApplicationName =               Config.Settings.ExceptioneerApplicationName,
                                     CurrentException = Server.GetLastError()
                                 };
                    wc.Submit(); 
                }
            }
            catch (Exception)
            {
                Logger.Write("Cannot connect to Exceptioneer", "Admin Exceptions");
            }
            finally
            {
                UIExceptionHandler.HandleException(Server.GetLastError(), true);
            }
}
</pre>
<p>Im seriously chuffed with this product and would recommend this to anyone! <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">They even give you a free version that lets you log 2000 exceptions a month via 3 applications</span></strong>. As soon as i can ill be upgrading to the next account level to get more of our work stuff in here!</p>
<p>Thanks again Exceptioneer!</p>
