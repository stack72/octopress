  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was recently referred to <a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/EasyHttp" target="_blank">EasyHTTP</a> by it&rsquo;s creator, <a href="http://twitter.com/hhariri" target="_blank">Hadi Hariri</a>. Hadi was looking at some code I had sent him regarding my work with the <a href="http://jetbrains.com/teamcity" target="_blank">TeamCity</a> REST API and thought that things could be a little easier and less verbose.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/13bd7e958c74e45280f7.js"></script>
<p>In summary my application creates a new HttpWebRequest passing in the request type as a magic string. It opens a stream to read the JSON response and that JSON is then de-serialised to an entity. It was very messy. In order to call this class from my application I would have had to do the follow:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dde8df43b79f7200c517.js"></script>
<p>There is absolutely no mention of whether the request was a GET never mind a PUT or a DELETE. This is where EasyHTTP came in for me.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/bfef5d881c07f748eca5.js"></script>
<p>I was able to make a generic method for a GET request. This method takes a url and a type and with the help of <a href="http://jsonfx.net/" target="_blank">JsonFx</a>, de-serialises the response back to the requested type. THis was a great way to take the hassle out of my old code where I was creating a Url, calling a request and then de-serialising it. The code in the calling class now looks as follows:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/9ef7d6c027f865b7a8cc.js"></script>
<p>I was originally using the <a href="http://james.newtonking.com/pages/json-net.aspx" target="_blank">Newtonsoft JSON library</a> for my de-serialising my JSON back to types and to do that I had to decorate the properties with code similar to the following:</p>
<p>[JsonProperty(PropertyName = &#8220;id&#8221;)]<br /> public string Id {get; set;}</p>
<p>This would effectively map a piece of JSON to a property that was not named <strong>exactly</strong> the same. EasyHTTP took care of this for me as well. To quote Hadi, EasyHTTP handles mapping as follows:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;For mapping properties, it handles camelcase, lowercase and a bunch of other conventions. You can also specify explicitly&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Using EasyHTTP, I was able to cut at least 2 lines of code per method in the client code. I was also able to delete an attribute that was present on <strong>all properties in the entities</strong> in a little bit of work.</p>
<p>The added distinction of creating the notion of GETs, PUTs and DELETE calls from each other mean that my class can be extended much easier. Hadi has written a post on EasyHTTP on <a href="http://hadihariri.com/2011/01/16/easyhttp/" target="_blank">his blog</a>. I would strongly suggest reading this and discovering if you can use this application in place of old HttpWebRequest calls. Its cleaner and helps to make code a little bit more DRY. My thanks to Hadi (and any contributors there may be) for making my work in this area a little easier!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a real pain point with the <a href="http://www.iis.net/download/urlrewrite" target="_blank">IIS Rewrite tool</a> today. I wanted to take an out of the box canonical rewrite rule and then modify it slightly to fit my own scenario. This tool is very easy to setup simple, out of the box rules &ndash; e.g. in order to get a simple canonical url rewrite (<a href="http://test.com">http://test.com</a> to redirect to <a href="http://www.test.com">http://www.test.com</a> then we would do as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_27.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_25.png" border="0" alt="image" width="250" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>You then enter the primary host name &ndash; in my case it is <a href="http://www.test.com">www.test.com</a><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_28.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_26.png" border="0" alt="image" width="244" height="153" /></a></p>
<p>That is it! The rule is now set up &ndash; pretty easy eh! This will redirect any request that isn&#8217;t http://www.test.com to become http://www.test.com. The following code is added to the web.config file in order to make this work:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/479580648e7a468780f7.js"></script>
<p>So this wasn&rsquo;t quite right for my setup. I have a main URL that sits with the load balancer &ndash; lets say that is <a href="http://www.test.com">www.test.com</a> <strong>but</strong> I have individual URLs associated with the individual servers lets say an example is <a href="http://server1.internal-test.com">http://server1.internal-test.com</a>. I use individual server URLs for server monitoring &ndash; <a href="http://www.pingdom.com/" target="_blank">Pingdom</a> will constantly hit a specific page on the individual server to test for uptime. The canonical rule I have listed above will redirect the individual URL to the load balanced URL so I had to try and change the built in rule. Firstly I tried to do this via the web.config and adding my own lines. <strong>This did not work at all</strong>. I could find little documentation about how the rule is constructed so I was basically just &#8220;hacking&#8221; the rule to try to get it to work.</p>
<p>Then I went and used the built-in editor for the IIS rewrite tool. When I seen the list of rules I double clicked on the rule and got the following screen:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_29.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_27.png" border="0" alt="image" width="224" height="244" /></a></p>
<p>This is where I finally got my editing correct. I had to add a condition to list -</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_30.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_28.png" border="0" alt="image" width="244" height="162" /></a></p>
<p>This did not offer my any type of drop down list for the different options I had for condition input &ndash; as you can see it is currently selected as {QUERY_STRING}. I didn&rsquo;t realise I had to change this. But once I had figured this out I changed it to look as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_31.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_29.png" border="0" alt="image" width="244" height="162" /></a></p>
<p>This was the correct rule &ndash; it says in pseudo terms &ndash; if the URL does not match this format then perform the redirect to the canonical host. This left me with the following web.config entry</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/0b44fed10f6ad782fd76.js"></script>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was way too easy to mess up. I would love there to be a way to test my rules in an actual scenario &ndash; a sample application that I could pass requests to and see what the response would be. I hope you don&rsquo;t fall into this rewrite rule trap! Please, IIS team, make it easier to test the rules that I have created.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post is the second post in a series on how CI will help a development team. The first post talks about the <a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/post/How-to-get-started-with-CI.aspx" target="_blank">benefits that CI will bring to the team</a>. (CI = continuous integration)</p>
<p>So you have decided to try and introduce CI into your team? Good choice! This can be a pretty tough time for you. You will need to justify any cost and infrastructure required and you <strong>may</strong> face questions about the choices you make. You should not let implementation of CI impact your day to day role or the company may question where your time is being spent. CI should be quick and easy to get running and then projects be moved to it over a period of time.</p>
<p>Below are some of the hardware options to consider when introducing a CI environment to a team/company:</p>
<h5>Server</h5>
<p>If you manage to get yourself a full server setup for your first CI implementation then I am very jealous! Servers cost money to buy, setup and maintain so you have either done a great job of selling the benefits or your company have really bought into the entire concept. Or both! Good work!</p>
<h5>Spare Development Machine</h5>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t get a server and there is a small budget available then I would suggest getting yourself a development standard machine to start using. This only needs access to the network and source control. IF there is 0 budget available but you have an old development lying spare then use that instead. This will be plenty powerful enough to run CI tooling and is a common starting point.</p>
<h5>Virtual Machine</h5>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t get a server or a physical development machine then don&rsquo;t worry. The battle is not lost here. You can run a VM somewhere (testing server maybe) that will act as a CI server. Of course this will not be hugely powerful, but it is perfectly acceptable to start with this. This is actually all I was able to get by my company. It was cheap (existing infrastructure) and fast to setup (they have a standard way of deploying VMs).</p>
<h5>Local CI server</h5>
<p>This is my least preferred option. But if there is nothing else you have access to then it will act as a decent starting point. The trouble with running a CI server locally is that the machine may have all the dependencies installed (VS, SDKs etc.) and the process may be able to find any references that would be classed as &ldquo;missing&rdquo; on other infrastructure, from the GAC. This could result is false positives when running builds. This can then lead to bum deployments where files or references are missing that can cause hassle for your application.</p>
<h4>So how do I choose one?</h4>
<p>A lot of the decision will come down to what you actually want to do with it. Lets think of the scenario 30 developers checking in 5 times a day and there is a version control trigger to build on check in then of course we need something that&#8217;s powerful in order to process these queued builds. The other implication here &ndash; build time &ndash; but we will talk about that later. It would not be feasible for a local machine to be doing this amount of processing as this would effectively cut your development time. But if you had 2 developers who were doing only a few check ins a day then a less powerful machine is viable.</p>
<p>The tip here is to think about your current setup &ndash; good VCS habits mean multiple check ins and lots of developers mean higher spec machine is needed &ndash; in this case a VM or local machine may not be viable.</p>
<p>DVCS (git or Hg) can mean less pushes to main repo by developers and less builds required. Thus the local machine or VM could be viable.</p>
<p>Regardless of which option you take, remember the golden rule. <strong>CI servers should be as free of installed dependencies as possible in order to mimic the live environments. </strong>There will be a later post to talk about installed dependencies.</p>
<p>This article has tried to point out some of the infrastructure choices that we have when initially introducing CI to a tam. It is not an exhaustive list but it is the options I had when I have setup my own environments. If you feel any others should be added then please leave comment and I will update the list.</p>
<p>The next post will talk about the different options available for CI tooling and how to choose the correct tool for you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I use a tool called <a href="http://satisfyr.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Satisfyr</a>. This tool helps me to keep to the 1 assert per test rule. It is a way to perform lambda-based assertions from within tests. It is written by <a href="http://twitter.com/kzu">Daniel Cazzulino</a> (developer of World of VS and Moq to name a few things).</p>
<p>I use Satisfyr when I am testing translations between DTO and Business objects that go through an automapper layer. This allows me to turn this:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/00f39983d7dba985c3bf.js"></script>
<p>into this:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/9b06319c46c5add9f1ee.js"></script>
<p>Its just syntactical sugar but it helps me to assert that an object is correct - this includes its properties etc. Hope it helps.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my favourite new tools to come across in 2011 is <a href="http://nsubstitute.github.com/" target="_blank">NSubstitute</a>. This a is friendly substitution framework for .net. This will allow me to use these substitutes in place of mocks and stubs. Traditionally I use a mocking framework that requires the use of mocks and stubs. Unfortunately, this type of tool has now become a bit of a hindrance for me. The code that is written to assert behaviour has happened seems complex and is not instantly readable for junior developers. Now this isn&rsquo;t a tool bashing exercise &ndash; this post is to demonstrate that this tool (NSubstitute) has effectively made me see the complexity of my tests. It has made me think about being more expressive in my intent. Its not about the tool itself &ndash; its about the concept behind it.</p>
<p>On the commencement of a new project, i tried to show some developers NSubstitute. They liked it &ndash; they said on first look it was easy to read test code. I suggested they try it for the new project as it was brand new and had 0 test count. I was immediately shot down due to an apparent &ldquo;learning curve&rdquo; and &ldquo;sticking with what they know&rdquo;. I understand the learning curve part &ndash; learning a new tool is potentially tough as its a real shift in what they know. The apathy of sticking with what they knew really saddens me. If I had this level of apathy, I&rsquo;d still be working with ASP.NET webforms 2.0 and still not unit testing like I was doing 7 years ago. We should all want to push ourselves a little and move outside our comfort zone in order to mature as professionals. Its effectively how we grow, learn and get better at what we do.</p>
<p>I can understand why a developer would not what to change to a new tool when working in an established project. It would be like a rewrite of a section of the project. It would also take time and money to change. But when it is a brand new project with no current toolset what is the issue? Seems a little strange to me.</p>
<p>From my investigations about this topic of mocks and stubs vs. fakes / substitutes, I have seen that there is a real lack of understanding of the differences between mocks and stubs. This article will not talk about the differences &ndash; <a href="http://martinfowler.com/aboutMe.html" target="_blank">Martin Fowler</a> has already done this in his article <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html" target="_blank">Mocks aren&rsquo;t stubs</a> and there is no way I could do it the justice he has. This has really led me to the question <em>do we really need to care about the differences of mocks and stubs when we have this level of complexity in our tests?.</em> As a developer who tries to push testing to a team, all I want to do is to take an object or a class and test that some logic or behaviour has happened and I get the correct result. We <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">don&rsquo;t want to</span> shouldn&rsquo;t make this difficult for ourselves by trying to decide if the object or class that we want should be a mock or a stub.</p>
<p>I have heard of people who get this concept so mixed up that they try and verify all expectations against stubs so they get passing unit tests when this is of course not correct. This is to show sample of implementation of that test.</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/a618e24f7a6967b730e2.js"></script>
<p>This shows a test with mocking and stubbing to check that specific behaviour has happened</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/192394caae6914998a12.js"></script>
<p>The same behaviour using substitutes / fakes to demonstrate how much easier it can be without the layer of complexity (written by <a href="http://twitter.com/davetchepak">Dave Tchepak</a> from NSubstitute). Dave did point out that other tools can drive this expressive type of test and also he could write complex looking tests with NSubstitute as well.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1056347.js"></script>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the first developer to talk about this topic and I&rsquo;m certainly not the last. I think it&rsquo;s a topic that requires buy in/ backing from a host of developers who lead the way. When talking about this on twitter, <a href="http://hadihariri.com/" target="_blank">Hadi Hariri</a> said the following:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;People need to understand the difference between state and interaction testing, not stubs/mocks/fakes/dupes/blabla&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>This is very true! Let&rsquo;s remove this barrier of complexity in our tests and learn how to write better tests. It doesn&#8217;t matter which tool we use to do it. Join me in trying to get developers to take the plunge!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About a year ago (July 2010), I started working with my current company. When I started the team were lacking in process and the process they had was not as useful as it could be for developers. The first thing I done in that team was to restructure the VCS and introduce continuous integration (CI).</p>
<p>The reason I chose these 2 practices first was that the team were not working as productively as they could be. There were no VCS regular check-ins and merging was hell. A good set of practices in VCS and a CI server to help spot merge issues up front was my idea of a step forward.</p>
<p>CI was a tough sell to the team. They didn&#8217;t like the fact that it took time to introduce, they didn&#8217;t like the fact that people could see everyone&#8217;s mistakes and the company wasn&#8217;t sure of the cost of the products and infrastructure needed. Originally, it was not fully understood why CI would be good for us and what it would help. I examined the current state of development and concluded that due to bad VCS practices it was becoming more and more difficult to &lsquo;ship&rsquo; a version of the site. The points were how i eventually sold it:</p>
<ul>
<li>earlier notification of integration errors</li>
<li>elimination of bad reference and dependency management</li>
<li>raising the confidence of developers</li>
</ul>
<p>The team had a very bad management of references and dependencies in our visual studio solutions. There were GAC references and files missing everywhere. There was no standardisation of 3rd party tool storage. This led to deployment nightmares as there was a <strong>post release</strong> scramble to find missing dlls &amp; files and FTP them to the live server. I was able to point out that&nbsp; CI system meant we could find dependency issues and missing files faster (on every check in as it happens).</p>
<p>After a few weeks in place the developer confidence got higher. They were more confident of deployments and the team went from deploying once every few months to weekly then to twice weekly and then 3 times weekly. It became more of a lean production line as something was working on &ndash; checked into VCS and then the following day (or 2 days) it went live.</p>
<p>IF you are struggling with selling CI to your company or even if you are trying to introduce your company to CI then the following posts are a summary of the steps I had to go through to get CI integrated into our working practices. It started as a proof of concept, to demonstrate the benefits and it has grown exponentially for me. The posts are:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There seems to be a lack of understanding about what continuous delivery is. I feel that continuous delivery has an ambiguous meaning to continuous deployment. This post will help to explain my understanding of both terms in relation to my experience of both.</p>
<h4>What is continuous delivery?</h4>
<p>Continuous delivery is the process of having a shippable product/ piece of software after each check in to source control. At work I work on an up and coming quiz site. On&nbsp; successful check in, i have a <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/" target="_blank">TeamCity</a> that fires and my web application is build in release mode, is packaged with the correct 3rd party dependencies and correct web.config transformations.</p>
<p>This application is then a potentially shippable product. In theory, I could open an FTP client and push the package to the correct web server and it would work as expected.</p>
<h4>What is continuous deployment?</h4>
<p>This is the process of shipping your product after every check in to source control. When starting out it is a very scary thought and really should not be implemented without real thought. In order to implement this in a team, you need to be 100% confident that the work they are checking in is fully tested and works 100% as expected. Unit tests, integration tests and other types of testing will help to ensure this confidence.</p>
<p>GiveCamp UK, a site i look after, is setup in a continuous deployment manner. I have a local git repository and I can check in freely to that repository. When i push to github, my CI server triggers a release build and then actually pushes the changes to the live site automatically.I can make 3 or 4 deliveries a day in this format. I have heard of teams who can do this up to <a href="http://timothyfitz.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/continuous-deployment-at-imvu-doing-the-impossible-fifty-times-a-day/" target="_blank">50 times a day</a>.</p>
<p>In my opinion, continuous deployment is not a natural progression from CI. It will take time for a CI process to mature and help the development team to be more effective in their work. For example, a developer continually forgets to check in files when he checks in, release script fires, files are missing therefore site could not work correctly. Successful deployments would suffer and errors recorded on site may increase. A good CI process will help the developers to stop these types of mistakes.</p>
<p>For me, the natural progression after CI, is continuous delivery. The potential for your application to be in a shippable state after every check in <strong>is</strong> an achievable goal. Once you deploy these &lsquo;packages&rsquo; and the confidence in the process increases could you then progress to automatically deployment as part of the process. For me, its the holy grail of dev ops work although I have read that it isn&rsquo;t for others. My argument to them would be a quote I once read:</p>
<p><em>A bad developer will manually carry out the same tasks repeatedly, a good developer will automate the task, a great developer will make the task obsolete.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I will let you draw your own conclusions as to which of the 3 types of developer in the quote related to CI, continuous delivery and continuous deployment. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post denotes the attributes needed in order to help form an effective team. They are attributes that I have worked to bring to my current team and therefore reflect on what my experience of forming a team.</p>  <h4>Process</h4>  <p>Some developers and methodologies do not believe in process. Some simply say that process is a means to fail. I believe that this is incorrect – every team needs some sort of basic process. A basic process will help to standardise the way we work, our environment, our development&#160; methodology or our release procedures. It helps to make sure that we are all on the <strong>same </strong>team. The process doesn&#8217;t need to be strict or detailed – in fact I believe that teams that have processes that are *too* heavy will find the processes getting in the way of actually doing their work.</p>  <p>If the process fails then we have an issue. Lets think about a planning process that has gone wrong (iteration planning). The process details that the developers will have a written specification available before they plan the time needed to complete the tasks. If this is not followed then the task may not be completed within the timelines and this could impact the release of other products and also the schedule of the next feature.</p>  <h4>Trust</h4>  <p>This is a very important attribute of a team. IF there is little (or no) trust, then the team will not be able to effectively work together. This can be as trivial as trusting that the developer can meet their deadline or that they care enough about their work that they will put as much effort as they can into it. If there is little trust, then negativity and insecurity can creep into a team. Being in a trusting environment helps to breed confidence.</p>  <h4>Communication</h4>  <p>For me this is the <strong><u>fundamental</u></strong> attribute of a *team*. Let&#8217;s think of a football team that does not talk to each other. They would be a group of individuals that has no way of working together. So the need for a development team to be able to communicate means they can work effectively not only with each other, but also with the business (understanding requirements) to find solutions to any problems that they are faced with.</p>  <p>If a team cannot communicate, how can we be sure they are able to work effectively? They may duplicate areas of the code, not understand requirements or even start tasks that have already been started by another developer.</p>  <h4>Leadership</h4>  <p>What a team needs is a leader. I have heard of self managing teams but they feel like a mythical beast to me. A team needs 1 person to make sure they we are all striving for the same goal. The leader can be the voice of reason when it comes to disputes and help to settle those disputes. A good leader has the ability to motivate developers. They can empower developers to make decisions on how things are done. They can help to increase the trust levels in the team with that empowerment.</p>  <p>If the leader is weak then the team can start to disintegrate. This is a bad situation to be in. If we take away trust or communication then the team can start to disintegrate. We *can* live without process and structure but we need strong individuals around to help push in the correct direction and form a set of informal methodologies.there are other attributes required (motivation, passion and a sense of responsibility) but these fall outside the core attributes of the team in my eyes.</p>  <p>So in summary, if a team doesn’t possess the basic attributes needed to bond then they are already starting on the wrong foot. A strong leader will help to cement a team together. The team can start with a sound, simple process and communication which will ensure trust bonds the team further. Keeping a team together is not easy work either – it’s like a relationship – it needs to be worked at. Simple practices, like morning stand-ups and retrospective meetings, will help to keep the bonds intact. I’d be very interested to grow this post with help from the community as to what other attributes they feel is necessary for an effective team to possess.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, 06 June 2011, was the second Guathon London run the the <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com" target="_blank">DDD</a> guys. On today&#8217;s session listing was ASP.NET MVC 3, Knockout.Js, C#5 and asynchronous Web applications and cloud computing with Windows Azure.</p>  <p>First on the bill was <a href="http://twitter.com/scottgu" target="_blank">Scott Guthrie</a> to do a 2 hour round robin talk on building an app using ASP.NET MVC 3, EF Code First, NuGet, and IIS. This was a whirlwind talk as usual as there was so much to cover. It wasn’t anything new to me as I use these technologies on a day-to-day basis at work. I also used them to create <a href="http://www.givecamp.org.uk" target="_blank">GiveCamp UK</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://twitter.com/stevensanderson" target="_blank">Steve Sanderson</a> then talked about <a href="http://knockoutjs.com" target="_blank">knockout.js</a>, his personal web UI framework. Knockout is a JavaScript library that helps you to create rich, responsive display and editor user interfaces with a clean underlying data model. This library uses an MVVM approach in order to bind data to a UI. The way of writing the code is very nice but I must admit I was not convinced of its usefulness to me in this short introduction to it. this was due to a number of reasons:</p>  <ul>   <li>non degradation of the JavaScript</li>    <li>I have questions about its accessibility</li>    <li>i have questions about how you would actually write maintainable tests for this framework</li> </ul>  <p>This is not to say I hate the framework. This just means that initially I must say that my barriers went up as it made me feel outside my comfort zone. I will have a look into it a bit more before I make my mind up on whether I’d use it or not. Right now I’m unconvinced.</p>  <p>After the lunch break, Steve Sanderson was back on stage to take about the use of the new C#5 features (async and await) in order to create asynchronous web applications in ASP.NET vNext. This mean that Steve showed off some of the new MVC4 features and used a NuGet package, called <a href="http://stack72.me/ku1am5 " target="_blank">SignalR</a>. The talk demonstrated how the syntax in MVC4 will be a lot cleaner and readable that MVC3 where we use the Async and Completed methods in order to carry out async tasks. It seems to me that async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; will be of great use to me in the future.</p>  <p>Steve then talked about taking the real time web beyond ajax. The talk spoke about polling, long polling and web sockets. This was my first sight of web sockets and they look very useful although it was pointed out that it was not ready for production applications yet due to non finalised specification. Steve took the long polling example and showed how we can use async in a chat room and voting application. The demos looked simple and easy to read and the MVC4 code looked good</p>  <p>The last talk of the day was back to the ‘Gu’ himself. This time he was talking on cloud computing. Scott was quick to point out that this was his first time talking about Azure since he took his new job and that even though he had taken that job, he was still very much a part of the ASP.NET team.</p>  <p>This talk was split into numerous parts. The first few pointing out what Azure is, what it’s infrastructure is made up of and how to take a simple application, make it ‘cloud ready’ and then deploy to the Azure platform. The next part focused on fault tolerance and latency and this was useful to see. My experience of developers new to ‘the cloud’ is that they take a web app, deploy to the cloud and this it’s automatically scalable. This is of course not strictly true.</p>  <p>Scott then talked about using servicebus as a message queuing service to help create a more load levelled application. The scalability of applications created in this way, means that instances of an app can be increased at peak times through code, Azure management API or via service configuration file changes.&#160; The talk was then refocused on how the cloud has made data storage cheaper and more efficient as the cost has dropped considerably over the years. Storing terabytes of data is now not an issue. It was pointed out that Azure replicated data storage in 3 locations for availability and consistency.</p>  <p>Mentions of Sql Azure and Table storage were made and Scott explained the benefits they bring like auto backups, auto sharding etc. The final demo was federated security using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/aa570351" target="_blank">WIF</a>. This allows the use of partner API’s (facebook Id, Google Id, Live id and active directory) in order for users to sign into your website. This was a new thing for me and I am annoyed I didn’t know of it before as it would have made the creation of GiveCamp UK easier.</p>  <p>Overall, I enjoyed the event. Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/plip" target="_blank">Phil Winstanley</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/davesussman" target="_blank">Dave Sussman</a> and the DDD team for organising the event at short notice. Also thanks to Scott and Steve for coming along to speak. It is great to listen to presenters who really do know what they are talking about. It makes me jealous of all the folks heading to <a href="http://www.ndc2011.no/" target="_blank">NDC2011</a> to hear more of these kind of talks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>We</strong> have been meaning to write a post like this for a long time but have never really had the audacity to do so. We thought the time is right to do it after a lot of stories we have been reading recently.</p>
<p>Over the past few months we have been seeing more and more articles, reports, tweets and basically any other form of communication where people are really putting down other products, methodologies or even other people. I myself have been guilty of this in the past but I felt as though I had to &ldquo;grow up&rdquo;. As We started speaking at various events and talking with other speakers, we saw that we needed to change this attitude; to learn to see issues as not just black or white but grey also.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We feel that, as software developers, we all can create an aspect of crap software. There is no-one on this earth that will create perfect software in their first attempt. This goes for the bigger software houses as well &ndash; Microsoft, Google, Novell, IBM etc.. but this doesn&#8217;t stop us from striving to do so.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the industry we work in seems to thrive on companies trying to make out their product/software is better than the product/software of another company, although this may be standard marketing practice it won&#8217;t necessarily help gain users since when we developers get our hands on it we can very quickly determine if it is any good or not.</p>
<p>One of the worst examples was witnessed earlier this year during a well known conference. A well known team directly demoed their product against a competitor product and pointed out all the wonderful things that their new product will do over the competition. Whilst the new product may be good, people on Twitter were quickly able to determine the veracity of the claims and tweeted with relish when one was found to be false.</p>
<p>We see other examples of this with developers having problems with TFS in comparison to Git/Hg/SVN, we see it in Win Phone 7 compared to iPhone/Android, HTML5 compared to Silverlight. Its everywhere! Its frankly becoming boring to read, see or listen to. Who are we to tell a company that their software is crap? Or that the software I use is better than what they product?</p>
<p>Continuously criticising something in public, yes I&#8217;m looking at you tweeple, just makes you look small for not being able to deal with whatever tool a business has decided to use. You may not like something and you are entitled to your opinions, you can tell the business that there may be something better, but if the business has made an investment and isn&#8217;t going to change then just shut up, sit down and do your job.</p>
<p>If you keep banging on about how something is bad or a complaining that a situation is unjust then it just starts making you look small, better to keep quiet and demonstrate through actions how there is a better way to do something and talk about the positives, generate a buzz about it and grow support to help you overcome the issues that you are seeing.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are subjective &ndash; so what&#8217;s good for me is not strictly good to you. Our code may be good to us but may be bad for you. I think we all need to get off our high horses and just let people make their own decisions. We, as professionals, should deliver our opinions and then leave it there.</p>
