title: "TFS vNext â€“ Falls Short of the Mark"
comments: true

<p>After the <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">BUILD conference</a> (September 13 &ndash; 16), there was a lot of buzz about the next version of TFS. From the conference we heard that vNext was going to be a revelation. Since reading about it, and trialling it for myself (with Hosted TFS), I feel that the TFS team have fallen short of the mark, for me, on 1 of the major features they offer (there are more but I will stick with this one):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Version Control</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The current frustrations with TFS seem to be around painful version control problems. They include the workspace creating read-only copies of files locally that still need to be &lsquo;checked out&rsquo; before they can be edited. If you delete a file from the file system then TFS doesn&rsquo;t (currently) see that the file has been deleted. It has also been reported that &lsquo;Get-Latest&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t realise that some files have changed when they actually had. Offline mode didn&rsquo;t work well apparently when it came to a re-sync. The list could go on.</p>
<p>I thought that feedback would have been taken on-board that the version control side of TFS was not fantastic. A lot of people have started to look for alternative ways to use a 3rd party VCS tool with TFS. I honestly thought that Microsoft would allow 3rd party tool integration into TFS. This hasn&rsquo;t happened.</p>
<p>Improvements to TFS version control side of things were made. These included the idea of &lsquo;Local workspaces&rsquo;. This is a copy of the files locally that are not read-only. Changes to the files outside of the TFS environment will be picked up by TFS. Another change was to offline mode. When the system came back on-line then everything automatically re-synced.</p>
<p>My initial thoughts when I had heard about &lsquo;Local Workspaces&rsquo; was that Microsoft had finally hit that DVCS style system. I tweeted about this and was soon told, by a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/tfsbuck">TFS development manager</a>, that this was very much not the case. You still have to communicate with the server in order to do a &lsquo;get&rsquo;, &lsquo;commit&rsquo; etc. This becomes interesting when you work with hosted TFS.</p>
<p>What happens if I am working whilst commuting and do not have network access? You can <em>still</em> work as you can edit files locally and TFS sees the changes, as the improvements suggest. But the idea of everything automatically syncing when back on-line worries me. Its <strong>never</strong> that easy &ndash; look at merging with VCS systems &ndash; it can be a real pain. You cannot stage local commits with TFS local workspaces. Its sounds good &ndash; a local workspace &ndash; when in reality it is only a SVN style of VCS. This can be good &ndash; but not for when working in an offline mode.</p>
<p>What I think Microsoft should have done it to move straight towards the local workspace being a DVCS style system. This would be the most useful approach for those who would be using hosted TFS in an offline format &ndash; a lot of developers <strong>do actually</strong> travel and work whilst doing so. I could then work locally and when I have a network connection push my local changes back to the TFS server.</p>
<p>Developer needs in a VCS have changed. The rise of DVCS style systems have made this happen. Therefore implementing a CVCS style of system feels as though TFS is going back to 2000, when SVN was first introduced. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like it is moving in a tangible way to that of developer needs. TFS takes care of a lot of the ALM cycle &ndash; it has a CI style tool,&nbsp; version control, bug tracking etc. but as long as I have Git, TeamCity and YouTrack then it is not something I feel I could move towards. It feels very old fashioned in comparison to these tools.</p>
