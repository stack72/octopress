<p>I have seen a lot of job adverts in the past few months. I have even written a few myself for some roles at my current company. As we know job adverts tend to be boring! They suggest the things that the developer needs to be to work in a company.</p>
<p>As a potential employee I sometimes don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a great way to attract me to your company. I could pass the interview and take the job then after a few months feel as though the environment doesn&rsquo;t suit me. What do I do then?</p>
<p>I have just today seen a new recruitment drive by <a href="http://www.thesitedoctor.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Site Doctor</a> which aims to cure that exact issue. They have released a new site to help them attract new employees &ndash; this is a chance for them to sell their company to you rather than the traditional what can you do for us!</p>

<p>I wish more companies done things like this &ndash; its a great way for them to show they are head and shoulders above the rest! Please have a look at the site &ndash; I was truly impressed by their attitude!</p>
