  <div class="entry-content"><p>2011 was an excellent year for me. Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t see the point in setting myself clear personal goals for it.&nbsp; But here is my retrospective of my personal work. This post does not include anything that happened at work or in my personal life. 2011 was the year:</p>
<p><strong>1. I started speaking at user groups / events</strong> <br />In total I spoke at 26 events. This included some bigger events (DDD) in Reading. Scotland, Bristol and Sunderland as well as a lot of user group events all around the country. Unfortunately, 2 had to be cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances but I will make it up to those groups in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; I was made a Jetbrains Academy Member <br /></strong>I still cannot believe this happened and I am honoured at being involved with it. I hope to be part of some big things with this academy and I look forward to continuing to be part of it in 2012. You can read more about this program on the Jetbrains <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/devnet/academy/index.html">site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. I helped organise GiveCamp UK</strong> <br />Even now, almost 3 months after the event, I am still on a high about this. It was certainly something I can look back on in my career and be really proud to have been part of such a fantastic weekend. More information on GiveCamp and a chance to sign up for the 2012 event can be done on the GiveCamp UK <a href="http://www.givecamp.org.uk/">site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4. I was Technical Reviewing books <br /></strong>I was part of the reviewing effort of <a href="http://manning.com/palermo3/">MVC3 In Action</a> and <a href="http://manning.com/jackson/">HTML5 for the .Net Developer</a> both by Manning Books. For those who know me, I can be quite opinionated and this was a great opportunity for me to take those opinions in order to help shape a book.</p>
<p><strong>5. I was accepted as a Friend of Redgate <br /></strong>Redgate run a program that helps bring together some well known community members and MVPs in order to help give feedback on their products. This was another great opportunity for me to use my opinions and experience in order to help evaluate the products developers use on a daily basis. You can read more about this program on the Redgate <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/our-company/about/community-relations/friends-of-rg">site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>6. I started my first real OSS project &ndash; TeamCitySharp <br /></strong>As an avid TeamCity user, this was a project that I really enjoyed writing. IT is now approaching 100 downloads from Nuget.org, 27 watchers, 7 forks and 11 pull requests on github. I am very happy with it. You can find the project on my <a href="http://github.com/stack72/TeamCitySharp">github repository</a>.</p>
<h3>What does 2012 hold for me?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m honestly not too sure what 2012 has in store for me. 2011 was such a fantastic year that I am not sure I can top it.&nbsp; Bit it does give me the opportunity to speak at 2 international events. <a href="http://codemash.org/">Codemash</a> and <a href="http://softwarepassion.se/">Software Passion Summit</a>. Hopefully there will be more well known events that I can submit sessions and speak at but there are so many fantastic speakers that I have to be on top of my game.</p>
<p>I hope 2012 is half as good a year for me as 2011! I look forward to it&hellip;&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During a work trip, I was prompted to get back into recalling how memory management in .net works as my company found a bit of an issue when they migrated their codebase from .net 3.5 to .net 4.</p>
<p>Lots of searching on Google and reading of MSDN documentation helped me get back to speed on what I knew before and then I found an email from <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/">Redgate</a> in my inbox. Those awesome folk have created a simple storyboard of how it works to make it easy to understand. This has been sent to all the developers on my team as this is a great resource.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hot on the heels of the first release of <a href="http://github.com/stack72/teamcitysharp">TeamCitySharp</a>, a new update has been released for the project to <a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/TeamCitySharp">nuget</a>. There were 2 major additions to the project both contributed via pull requests on Github.</p>
<h4>Introduction of Build Locator</h4>
<p>This makes the protocol for obtaining build information easier as we use the locator in the url rather than trying to build a query string manually. Previously we built a query string as follows:</p>
<p>http://myserver.com/httpAuth/app/rest/buildTypes/id:bt437/builds?status=SUCCESS</p>
<p>This would get the successful builds for build config id 437. This has now been replaced by the following query string:</p>
<p>http://myserver.com/httpAuth/app/rest/builds?locator=buildType:id:bt437,status:SUCCESS</p>
<p>Thanks must go to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sibartlett">Simon Bartlett</a> for this addition to the codebase. The existing methods will work in this way as the code behind the public methods has been changed to us the build locator pattern. Therefore you can still call the method:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/90d156986380a6f43bd5.js"></script>
<p>Behind the scenes TeamCitySharp does the following call:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/47fa6fdb8ec5f4e2159c.js"></script>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>New Sample Build Monitor</h4>
<p>There is now a new project included in the source code. This project is a sample implementation of a build monitor using TeamCitySharp based on MVC3 and Knockout.js. Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/codingbadger">Barry Mooring</a> for contributing this sample to the project.</p>
<p>In order to use the build monitor you just need to go to the settings file and add the TeamCity url, username and password.</p>
<p>This gives a look and feel as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_38.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_36.png" alt="image" width="497" height="282" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can download the source from <a href="http://github.com/stack72/TeamCitySharp">Github</a> or via nuget (install-package TeamCitySharp). Please feel free to leave feedback about what you feel it is lacking or what you don&rsquo;t like about the project. This library will only be able to get better through help from users.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have heard people talking for a while on the TeamCity pricing strategy and thought I&rsquo;d write a post to start to get some opinions on what you think it should be changed to.</p>
<p>TeamCity users are very lucky that we have a free, without restriction, version of the software to use. It comes with 20 build configurations and 3 build agents. Unfortunately, people still do not find this adequate for their needs. The enterprise version has unlimited build configurations and 3 build agents and is approx. &pound;1600. So the question here is:</p>
<h4>What do you think the pricing model of TeamCity should be?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we can get good feedback, we can give this to Jetbrains in order to let them see what their customers feel they need. This post, or discussion, does not in any way guarantee that the pricing of the tool will change.</p>
<p>I have heard the following suggestions:</p>
<p>- Make the enterprise version come with 5 build agents <br />- Have a version between Free and Enterprise that allows like 70 build configurations <br />- Give the ability to buy package extras e.g. 20 build configurations for $500 etc.</p>
<p>What do you think? Comments required please!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://github.com/stack72/TeamCitySharp">TeamCitySharp</a> (TCS) is a simple .net wrapper that will let you interact with a TeamCity server providing you have a login for that system. TeamCity has a REST API but this wrapper will help simplify the calls that that API and deserialize the response for the server into POCOs for you.</p>
<p>In order to get a list of projects on a TeamCity server you would make the request to the following URL:</p>
<p><a href="http://&lt;serverurl&gt;/httpAuth/app/rest/projects">http://&lt;serverurl&gt;/httpAuth/app/rest/projects</a></p>
<p>In order to interact with this, you could use <a href="https://github.com/hhariri/EasyHttp">EasyHTTP</a> or HTTP WebRequest. You would set up a connection, specify a content type, give user credentials and then get a response back that you can use. TeamCitySharp has taken care of this for you. The corresponding code to make the same code using TeamCitySharp would be as follows:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/2a382b5c0699444d8cf4.js"></script>
<p>There are a number of methods available that will let you get projects, build status&rsquo;, build types, users, agents, user groups and server information. The project cannot be used to create projects or build types. This is due to the absence of the appropriate calls on the TeamCity REST API. A full list of functionality of the TeamCitySharp API calls can be found in the <a href="http://github.com/stack72/TeamCitySharp/blob/master/README.md">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>I have created a TeamCitySharp <a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/TeamCitySharp">nuget package</a> and you can install that from nuget command line using the comment:</p>
<p><strong>install-package TeamCitySharp</strong></p>
<p>This is very much an early version of the project in order to get user feedback. If you do try it then please do let me know what you don&rsquo;t like about it and what you feel it would benefit from. Thanks really must go to <a href="http://twitter.com/hhariri">Hadi Hariri</a> for the idea after I saw&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/YouTrackSharp">YouTrackSharp</a>.</p>
<p>Please feel free to fork the project and send any requests back you feel the project would benefit from. The project is distributed under the <a href="http://stack72.mit-license.org/">MIT license</a> so please adhere to this when using it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Until your pretty code is in production, making money, or doing whatever it does, you&#8217;ve just wasted your time&rdquo; -</em><a href="http://blog.chris-read.net/"><em> Chris Read</em></a><em> whilst at London CI.</em></p>
<p>In my opinion, this quote really sums up software development. Process and red tape are becoming an obstacle to more and more developers from doing what they are paid to do &ndash; create software.</p>
<p>I attended a talk by<a href="http://twitter.com/kendallmiller"> Kendall Miller</a> whilst at<a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011"> DDDScotland</a> entitled &ldquo;<a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=676">Creating your own software company: A survival guide</a>&rdquo;. I am a huge supporter of continuous delivery and have attended many sessions but this session was extremely useful to me. It was really the first time that the reasoning and importance of continuous delivery for developers really hit home with me. I knew the benefits and drawbacks but hearing someone actually demonstrate their experience really helped me. The most important thing I learned in this session was that you have got to get your software out early, this is particularly important when you are starting up a software company. Shipping software early will not only give you a source of much needed income, but can provide potentially useful feedback that can help shape the project before too much investment, both in terms of development time and money, is wasted. This goes hand in hand with the opening quote of this blog post.</p>
<p>I am a huge fan of clean, SOLID, DRY code and I cannot emphasise enough about why developers should write code in this fashion. I do understand that I may be giving a mixed message here. Is it possible to create software in a clean, SOLID and DRY way and in a fast time? Could we be sacrificing quality for delivery? In my opinion, this is simply not the case. There are some fantastic guide lines laid down by<a href="http://twitter.com/unclebobmartin"> Robert &lsquo;unclebob&rsquo; Martin</a> in his book,<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320920781&amp;sr=8-1"> Clean Code</a>. These guide lines do not take extra time to implement &ndash; they are baked in to how we write the code. As developers they should be second nature to us. If they aren&rsquo;t then you should address this as soon as you can.</p>
<p>Fast delivery can, however, affect architecture. Architecture is one of those areas of development that really does demonstrate a lot of ways to do achieve a single task. For example there are many different frameworks, tools, code layout etc. and these are another area to be concerned with. You can implement a solution to a problem that is clean &amp; efficient but that may not prove to be the best architecture. You could continue to work on this solution and refactor it to the nth degree until you come up with an architecture that you like.&nbsp; You may feel that you have used your development time wisely to improve your solution, when in actual fact, what you may have done is to waste your development resources refactoring when other solutions may be available to you.</p>
<p>I would argue that release fast, fail fast is a good way to develop. Get the code out there, let some decent A/B testing give feedback on its fit for purpose and let that shape the architecture. I understand this may be easier for start-up based systems as their customer base can initially be small. But I do not think it is only targeted towards them. Lets look at Google Chrome or Firefox as an example of this philosophy in practice. Changes to Chrome and Firefox are happening on a regular basis now. This means the companies can create a new piece of functionality, release it to users and collect feedback and know that feedback is targeted towards the last small release. This means they are letting the user feedback help drive the system. Firefox takes a lot of grief about how resource hungry it is. Releasing smaller code changes more often will help them see if they are addressing the issue.</p>
<p>Releasing a solution early can also bring problems of it&rsquo;s own. There are some companies out there that are of the opinion &ndash; if it has shipped and it works then why should we spend any more money on code improvements. This falls into the argument about Technical Debt which I will not cover in this post.</p>
<p>In summary, I believe software should be delivered in small, continual chunks. This helps create an efficient delivery mechanism that will give us a chance to collect useful feedback in a much more structured and continual way. We can use this feedback to deliver software that is better suited for its purpose and become better at what we are paid to do!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have recently started looking into the new html specification (HTML5) and have noticed that benefits of this new specification include improved semantics and cleaner mark-up.&nbsp;<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded information over its presentation.</span>&nbsp;Consider the following code snippet:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://gist.github.com/1328385.js"></script>
<p>This would usually denote a small area of navigation that loosely regards a navigational class on a html page. The loose association to the navigation is because I had the sense to name the class &#8220;navigation&#8221;. Had I named the class &#8220;list&#8221; then this would have meant nothing to the reader of the mark-up. The &lt;h2&gt; tag relates to the &lt;div&gt; but is actually not part of the mark-up. HTML5 gives the ability to clean this mark-up and make it more semantic. the resulting code in HTML5 could be:</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://gist.github.com/1328389.js"></script>
<p>This code snippet actually lets the user see that the list of links are actually a small navigational element of the site. It will also relate the heading, Quick Links, to that small navigational element. There is another element, menu, that I will not talk about. It could be substituted for my use of &lt;nav&gt;</p>
<p>When I first started reading about HTML5 and how the semantics and cleanliness of the mark-up changed, it made be beg the question:</p>
<p><strong>Is HTML5 the excuse to get front end developers to think about Clean Code?</strong></p>
<p>I am a huge advocate of clean code. I expect my methods / classes and variables to have good naming conventions. I also expect the code to be short, concise and descriptive. I am a developer, not a designer. Design / front end development is usually my last port of call. therefore my mark-up and it&#8217;s structure usually suffer. this means that it can be poorly organised and when I test in different browsers, I sometimes have to shoehorn in fixes which results in my code being messy.</p>
<p>Html5 may not be a finished specification, but I for one will start to embrace it in my development. If there is an easy way for the front end mark-up to be as clean as business logic then I think we should all lobby the W3C to finalise the specification and get this new standard into place.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a huge advocate of automation and the automation of as much of a system as can be implemented. I like to make sure than non-developer members of staff can work effectively and try to do as much as possible to minimise the blockers in their way. IIS can be one of those blockers. When it comes to staff creating new sites and application pools, they can sometimes get it wrong. To make sure all members of my team have the <strong>exact same</strong> setup &ndash; I script the set-up.</p>
<p>A CI tool should be able to handle the automated rollout of configuration management to systems. This is just another example of making sure all parts of the environment have the correct set-up. Automating this rollout means a smaller chance of human error. Being able to interact with IIS means a simple script could be run to create the required setup &ndash; both locally and on a build environment.</p>
<p>I was able to create the following Powershell script.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/157876c2e6ca7518c290.js"></script>
<p>The script basically automates a way of creating a new application pool, a new site and then assigning that application pool to that site</p>
<p>This script was easily able to run from either powershell or via cmd line (which invokes powershell). It&rsquo;s a script that works perfectly well assuming you only need to run it once as it doesn&rsquo;t take into account the site or the application pool existing. It needed a lot of refactoring. the script that was produced can be found below. It is a lot more useful as it takes parameters for setup.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/f204abb6862bcf34f113.js"></script>
<p>The trouble I had with this script started when running in different versions of the OS. X64 machines call the X64 powershell by default (as you would expect). When using X64 powershell the following error was encountered:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_36.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://www.paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_34.png" alt="image" width="564" height="107" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This of course worked perfectly in X86 version of powershell. Weirdly, a different error was encountered in X86 powershell. The line</p>
<p>Test-Path IIS:\AppPools\</p>
<p>command didnt like working. It threw the following error:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_37.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://www.paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_35.png" alt="image" width="529" height="227" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I was faced with the dilemma of fixing something I know relatively little about (powershell scripts) or continue to use the simple script and manually manipulate IIS after the initial set-up.</p>
<p>Strangely, I chose to ditch both methods and wrote a C# console application to manipulate IIS. It took me half the time and was very easy. <a href="http://twitter.com/apwestgarth">Andrew Westgarth, IIS MVP</a>, replied to me on twitter after I said I had done this</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">I could have told you that :-) the .net APIs rock :-)</p>
<p align="center">It was as simple as referencing Microsoft.Web.Administration and writing code against that API. As it was a console application, it created an executible that I could call easily from TeamCity or via a batch script for local machine automation. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about ExecutionPolicy either, which is a real bonus.</p>
<p align="center">The source code for the console application is available on my github site. Feel free to take it and change pieces of it to suit you. I have also included both powershell scripts as listed above.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past week, I started experimenting with letting TeamCity create reports of CSS and XHTML Validation from the W3C website. In order to do this validation I was able to use their web URL and pass a URL to the web address. In order to do this I used <a href="https://github.com/hhariri/EasyHttp" target="_blank">EasyHTTP</a> as it took care of the web request in a very simple way</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/8ad9b4ceaca1e1a772d6.js"></script>
<p>When the response is caught, I was able to take the raw text part of the response and save to a html file. This code is very early proof of concept and plans are a foot to be able to pass in validation types and recursive list of files etc.</p>
<p>In order to run this from TeamCity, there was 1 very easy build configuration</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_32.png"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_30.png" alt="image" width="488" height="238" border="0" /></a></p>
<p align="center">I had pre-configured TeamCity to add new report tabs when the artifacts were available &ndash; using this <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/TCD5/Report+Tabs" target="_blank">article</a>. I was then able to tell TeamCity to show these report tabs by outputting the correct files as build artifacts:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_33.png"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_31.png" alt="image" width="501" height="236" border="0" /></a></p>
<p align="center">The reports can be found in the build results screen:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_34.png"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_32.png" alt="image" width="505" height="144" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">The code will be available very soon but if you feel you want it sooner then please do let me know. There may be changes to the reports but they look similar to the following:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_35.png"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/image_thumb_33.png" alt="image" width="520" height="290" border="0" /></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When it comes to the step between continuous delivery and continuous deployment (automated release of <strong>every</strong> good build), then the barrier I hear most often is <em>automated deployments work fine until we have database changes.</em></p>
<p>Can we be confident in saying that database deployments are the only barrier to continuous deployment? Probably not the only barrier, but there are a large part of the puzzle. There will be other factors, e.g. audit regulations regarding sign off of releases etc., but I don&rsquo;t think I would be frowned upon by agreeing with this statement.</p>
<p>I know there are many great tools out there will will help us overcome sql changes. Redgate&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-compare/" target="_blank">Sql Compare</a> can take 2 schemas and compare them to create a change script and a rollback script. This can be controlled by a CI tool. Others do a similar job, but Sql Compare is one I use regularly. Sql Server management studio can also be manipulated very easily via msbuild. So I can assure you it is <strong>very easy</strong> to automate sql deployments. But it scares a lot of people as they are worried they will kill their database. This is not a fear that is uncalled for if I am truthful.</p>
<p>Since there is the fear of damaging the database, some companies who are already doing continuous deployment will actively &lsquo;skip&rsquo; a deployment when sql changes are involved. This involves using VCS hooks. A typical hook would be the presence of a commit message, e.g. #Skip Deployment. This would then let source control / CI server know to handle the commit without the need for a deployment.</p>
<p>Back in late 2010, I was introduced to the concept of NoSQL databases. This is essentially any type of store that doe not use a relational model. I have been looking at NoSQL more and more and have recently pondered &lsquo;how easy would NoSQL based systems be to include in a continuous deployment system&rsquo;?</p>
<p>I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thought</span> the answer was that NoSQL <strong>was</strong> indeed the missing piece of the continuous deployment puzzle. If companies were only ever deploying code then that&rsquo;s easy right? Things are never that easy though. I looked further and then thought that if data was held in a store (of any kind) in a specific structure then how could we retrieve that data if the structure changed with the next system deployment.</p>
<p>I asked <a href="http://twitter.com/robashton" target="_blank">Rob Ashton</a>, a well know presenter of <a href="http://ravendb.net/" target="_blank">Raven DB</a>, this question. Rob said that it wouldn&rsquo;t work unless you ran some sort of data migration against the data structures or versioned them in some way. So, in essence it was a no! I&rsquo;m not disagreeing with Rob by any means but I still think NoSQL systems have got scope built in to allow us to handle automated deployments a little easier. As part of our development task, we could write the migration scripts for the data. We would have to do this anyway if we worked in a sql world. I&rsquo;m a coder, not a sql developer. Therefore I would be a lot happier writing code migrations rather than sql migrations. This means I would also be a lot happier about deployments where only code changes were involved.</p>
<p>I have not had time to try this approach as I am not skilled by any means in using NoSQL. So in essence, this is a theory but I am confident it has some wheels. What do you think?&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
