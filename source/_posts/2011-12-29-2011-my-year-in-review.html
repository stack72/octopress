<p>2011 was an excellent year for me. Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t see the point in setting myself clear personal goals for it.&nbsp; But here is my retrospective of my personal work. This post does not include anything that happened at work or in my personal life. 2011 was the year:</p>
<p><strong>1. I started speaking at user groups / events</strong> <br />In total I spoke at 26 events. This included some bigger events (DDD) in Reading. Scotland, Bristol and Sunderland as well as a lot of user group events all around the country. Unfortunately, 2 had to be cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances but I will make it up to those groups in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; I was made a Jetbrains Academy Member <br /></strong>I still cannot believe this happened and I am honoured at being involved with it. I hope to be part of some big things with this academy and I look forward to continuing to be part of it in 2012. You can read more about this program on the Jetbrains <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/devnet/academy/index.html">site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. I helped organise GiveCamp UK</strong> <br />Even now, almost 3 months after the event, I am still on a high about this. It was certainly something I can look back on in my career and be really proud to have been part of such a fantastic weekend. More information on GiveCamp and a chance to sign up for the 2012 event can be done on the GiveCamp UK <a href="http://www.givecamp.org.uk/">site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4. I was Technical Reviewing books <br /></strong>I was part of the reviewing effort of <a href="http://manning.com/palermo3/">MVC3 In Action</a> and <a href="http://manning.com/jackson/">HTML5 for the .Net Developer</a> both by Manning Books. For those who know me, I can be quite opinionated and this was a great opportunity for me to take those opinions in order to help shape a book.</p>
<p><strong>5. I was accepted as a Friend of Redgate <br /></strong>Redgate run a program that helps bring together some well known community members and MVPs in order to help give feedback on their products. This was another great opportunity for me to use my opinions and experience in order to help evaluate the products developers use on a daily basis. You can read more about this program on the Redgate <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/our-company/about/community-relations/friends-of-rg">site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>6. I started my first real OSS project &ndash; TeamCitySharp <br /></strong>As an avid TeamCity user, this was a project that I really enjoyed writing. IT is now approaching 100 downloads from Nuget.org, 27 watchers, 7 forks and 11 pull requests on github. I am very happy with it. You can find the project on my <a href="http://github.com/stack72/TeamCitySharp">github repository</a>.</p>
<h3>What does 2012 hold for me?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m honestly not too sure what 2012 has in store for me. 2011 was such a fantastic year that I am not sure I can top it.&nbsp; Bit it does give me the opportunity to speak at 2 international events. <a href="http://codemash.org/">Codemash</a> and <a href="http://softwarepassion.se/">Software Passion Summit</a>. Hopefully there will be more well known events that I can submit sessions and speak at but there are so many fantastic speakers that I have to be on top of my game.</p>
<p>I hope 2012 is half as good a year for me as 2011! I look forward to it&hellip;&hellip;</p>
