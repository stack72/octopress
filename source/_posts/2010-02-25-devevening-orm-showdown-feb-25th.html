<p>Tonight was <a href="http://devevening.co.uk/">DevEvening's </a>ORM Showdown and my first visit to a DevEvening.</p>
<p>The ORMs were demoed in thefollowing order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matt Lacey Demoed - <a href="http://www.subsonicproject.com/">Subsonic</a></li>
<li>Dave Hawes demoed - <a href="http://llblgen.com/defaultgeneric.aspx">LLBLGenPro</a></li>

<li>Any Pike demoed - <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/activerecord/index.html">Castle ActiveRecord</a></li>
<li>Nick Haslam demoed - <a href="http://www.telerik.com/products/orm.aspx">Telerik OpenAccess</a></li>

<li>Jez - Good Old ADO.NET via code generation tools :)</li>
</ul>
<div>All the talks were very useful as i hadn't seen or even heard of many of these products. i enjoyed seeing how these proudcts worked and hearing about poeple's experience using them. i think over the next few weeks ill give them all a go as they are mostly free [except for LLBLGenPro and OpenAccess]</div>
