<p>As I&rsquo;m a wannabe Evangelist, then I thought I&rsquo;d add a new feature to my blog.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Tool Of The Week</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong></strong></p>

<p align="left">This is of course something I like doing and nothing that anyone has asked me to do or to promote things. Last week [Week Ending 10th September], there were a few new things I tried out. Most were all around new notepad support as I have grown a little tired to Notepad++ and all the updates it tried to make me install. Therefore my tool of the week was <strong><a href="http://www.pnotepad.org/" target="_blank">Programmers Notepad 2</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong></strong></p>
<p align="left">There are a few reasons why I like this product:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Its free - This makes a huge difference I&rsquo;m afraid as I chop and change my mind over tools all the time about whether I use them of not. I also rebuild my home machine a lot and its less hassle to install OSS than paid for.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>When I tweeted about it the main creator took the time to actually acknowledge me.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Heard about it from a few others about how it has grown from something basic to what it is today</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p align="left">The reason I used this was for my MSBuild work for our CI server and I found the tool to be excellent. Have a look at it, its certainly worth that</p>

<p align="left">Thanks to Simon Steele for all the hard work! There are still some things I wish it would do &ndash; Commenting/ uncommenting code is the main one but I&rsquo;m happy with it!</p>

<p align="left">I give this tool 3.5/5 and a thumbs up!</p>
