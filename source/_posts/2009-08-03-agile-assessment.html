<p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: #333333; line-height: 16px;">Been a long time since i posted so thought id start again!<br /><br />just managed to convince my co-workers to take an Agile assessment [with thanks to those guys @ ThoughtWorks!] . this assessment works out just how Agile our environment is in comparison how we think it is.<br /><br />The results will be very interesting - i'm 100% sure we are not very good at the process and i'm going to spend then next 3 months trying to fix that :)<br /><br />Results to follow...........<br /><br />EDIT: bit of an anticlimax as ThoughtWorks server wouldn't let me post the results so that i could get the report. From the results of the team we all know where we are going with this concept anyway<br /><br />EDIT 2: Our team is actually classed as just stemming into AGILE development - this is a good result but we must continue to move forward with this<br /><br />Next step: Set up a task board in the office and convince the others to use it....</span></p>
