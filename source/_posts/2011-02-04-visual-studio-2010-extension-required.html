title: "Visual Studio 2010 Extension Required"

<p>I have just installed a new extension to Visual Studio 2010 using the Extension manager and then realised I&rsquo;d have to do the same at home. Seems very laborious doesn&rsquo;t it!! Why isn&rsquo;t there a way to be able to get an output of the installations you have installed and their download links (maybe in an xml type format) that I could then export and store in dropbox.</p>
<p>Format could have the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extension Name</li>
<li>Version</li>
<li>Download location/ online gallery location</li>
<li>Publisher</li>
</ul>
<ul>
I&rsquo;d then like to be able to take this xml file and import it to a new extension manager of my choice and then tell visual studio to go off and download the required extensions. In the era of cloud computing I really thought this would be possible I think its even more important when developers are switching between machines. 
</ul>
<p>Do we ever think something like this will be developed? Is anyone interested in a product like this &ndash; lets try and get it implemented! Its only the same functionality they have when you can export bookmarks and ftp locations from other tools.&nbsp;<img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" src="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/images/wlEmoticon-smile_4.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p>EDIT: There is currently the ability to have a personal Nuget repository so this 'extension repository' would be great for sharing in a team as well!</p>
